# Contributing Guidelines

view [CONTRIBUTING-zh.md](./CONTRIBUTING-zh.md) for Chinese version and translate guidelines.

_Pull requests, bug reports, and all other forms of contribution are welcomed and highly encouraged!_

## :bulb: Asking Questions

See our forum ([EN](https://discuss.moonbitlang.com/)/[ZH](https://taolun.moonbitlang.com/)). In short, GitHub issues are not the appropriate place to debug your specific project, but should be reserved for filing bugs and feature requests.

## :inbox_tray: Opening an Issue

Before creating an issue, check if you are using the [latest version](https://www.moonbitlang.com/download/) of MoonBit. If you are not up-to-date, see if updating fixes your issue first.

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report. :v:

In short, since you are most likely a developer, **provide a ticket that you would like to receive** :

- If you are using [playground](https://try.moonbitlang.com/), simply share the code that could reproduce the bug by clicking the share icon:

- If you are using [moon build](https://www.moonbitlang.com/docs/build-system-tutorial/), please provide the output of `moon version` and your OS version.

## :hammer: Contributing Code

We encourage contributors to use [GitHub's Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to submit their contributions, including but not limited to the following contributions:
- Fix errors in code/documentation
- Submit missing Chinese translations or improve translations

The documentation is divided into two parts: one is the interactive tutorial, and the other is the static detailed language documentation.

- For the interactive tutorial: the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/moonbitlang/moonbit-docs/tree/main/moonbit-tour/tour), and the Chinese content can be found [here](https://github.com/moonbitlang/moonbit-docs/tree/main/moonbit-tour/tour/zh).

- For the static detailed language documentation: the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/moonbitlang/moonbit-docs/tree/main/next), and the Chinese content can be found [here](https://github.com/moonbitlang/moonbit-docs/tree/main/next/locales/zh_CN/LC_MESSAGES), where it should be noted that the Chinese content is generated using the `gettext` tool, so special attention should be paid to the format of the translation files.

If you are interested in translating the documentation, please refer to the [Chinese version Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING-zh.md).
