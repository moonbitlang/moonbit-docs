# MoonBit Language

MoonBit is an AI native programming language toolchain for cloud and edge computing. It compiles to WebAssembly, JavaScript, and C.

The IDE environment is available at [https://try.moonbitlang.com](https://try.moonbitlang.com) without any installation; it does not rely on any server either.

**Status and aimed timeline**

MoonBit is currently in beta-preview. We expect to reach 1.0 in 2025.

When MoonBit reaches beta, it means any backwards-incompatible changes will be seriously evaluated and MoonBit *can* be used in production(very rare compiler bugs). MoonBit is developed by a talented full time team who had extensive experience in building language toolchains, so we will grow much faster than the typical language ecosystem, you won't wait long to use MoonBit in your production.

**Main advantages**

- Generate significantly smaller WASM output than any existing solutions.
- Much faster runtime performance.
- State of the art compile-time performance.
- Simple but practical, data-oriented language design.
