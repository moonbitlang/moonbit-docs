# E0059

Warning name: `unaligned_byte_access`

Unaligned byte access in bits pattern.

This warning is emitted when a bits pattern performs an unaligned byte access.
Consider adjusting the layout or using bit-level fields to keep accesses
aligned.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn f(x: Bytes) -> Unit {
  match x {
    [0x12, u1be(_), 0x34, ..] => ()
    _ => ()
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

Pad to the next byte boundary:

```moonbit
fn f(x: Bytes) -> Unit {
  match x {
    [0x12, u1be(_), u7be(_), 0x34, ..] => ()
    _ => ()
  }
}
```
