Range operators only support builtin integer types, they cannot be used on this
type.

## Erroneous example

For example, you cannot use `Float` nor `Double` with range operators.

```moonbit
fn main {
  for f in 0.0..<1.0 {
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

Use integer types for the range operators, and genearte floats from these
integers instead:

```moonbit
fn main {
  for i in 0..<10 {
    println(i.to_float())
  }
}
```

You can also use `until` to construct a range of numbers:

```moonbit
fn main {
  let range : Iter[Double] = (0.0).until(10.0)
  for i in range {
    println(i)
  }
}
```
