# E4086

The labels are required by this function, but not supplied.

Sometimes this error occurs when you mistakenly treat a labelled argument as a
positional argument. There are some common functions that require labelled
arguments, such as:

- `@test.snapshot`. Remember to supply `filename` as a labelled argument.
- `@test.inspect`. Remember to supply `content` as a labelled argument.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
pub fn f(name~ : String) -> Unit {
  println("Hello, \{name}")
}

fn main {
  f("John") // Error: The labels name~ are required by this function, but not supplied.
}
```

## Suggestion

Check the signature of the function and provide the correct labelled argument.

```moonbit
pub fn f(name~ : String) -> Unit {
  println("Hello, \{name}")
}

fn main {
  f(name="John")
}
```
