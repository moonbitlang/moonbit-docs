# E0044

Warning name: `invalid_inline_wasm`

Inline wasm code is invalid.

The inline wasm code refers to unbound function.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///|
extern "wasm" fn g() =
  #| (func $g (call $does_not_exist))
```

## Suggestion

If you know that such a function does exist, manually override suppress the
warning. Notice that the compilation error will result in an
[internal compiler error](E1001.md)

```default
{"warn-list": "-invalid_inline_wasm"}
```
