# E4160

Type mismatch with mbti.

When a package implements a
[virtual package](../../toolchain/moon/package.md#virtual-package), it is checked
against the interface of that virtual package, and this error is emitted if some
of the interface has different types.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
package "moonbit-community/E4160";

fn f() -> Unit
```

```moonbit
///|
pub fn f() -> Int {
  42
}
```

## Suggestion

Modify the implementation such that it has the exact signature as the virtual
package it declared to implement.

```moonbit
///|
pub fn f() -> Unit {

}
```
