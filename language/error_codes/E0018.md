# E0018

There is no `continue` in this loop expression, so `loop` is useless here.

This error occurs when using a `loop` expression that contains no `continue`
statement. In MoonBit, a `loop` without any `continue` statements is equivalent
to an block expression that will be executed only once, making the `loop`
keyword redundant in such cases. You should either add a `continue` statement if
you need to restart the loop from the beginning, or use a simpler control flow
construct like `match` or `if`.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn countdown(n : Int) -> Int {
  let mut count = n
  loop count {
    _..<0 => break
    _ => count = count - 1
  }
  return count
}
```

## Suggestion

Either add a `continue` statement if you need to restart the loop:

```moonbit
fn countdown(n : Int) -> Int {
  let mut count = n
  loop count {
    _..<0 => break
    _ => {
      continue count - 1
    }
  }
  return count
}
```

Or use `if`/`match` you don't need to use `continue`:

```moonbit
fn countdown(n : Int) -> Int {
  let mut count = n
  match count {
    _..<0 => ()
    _ => count = count - 1
  }
  return count
}
```
