# E4089

Tuple has no field with the given index.

In MoonBit, one can access the element in a tuple using index accessor, like
`tuple.0`, `tuple.1`, and so on. **The index starts with 0**, and the compiler
will emit this error if you try to access an element that does not exist in the
tuple, for example, accessing the third element (`tuple.2`) in a tuple with only
two elements.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn main {
  let tuple = (1, 2)
  println(tuple.2)
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, you need to access the element within the tuple that exists.

```moonbit
fn main {
  let tuple = (1, 2)
  println(tuple.1)
}
```
