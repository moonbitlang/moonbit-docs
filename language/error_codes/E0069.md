# E0069

Warning name: `declaration_implemented`

Declaration is already implemented.

This warning is emitted when a declaration is implemented more than once.
Remove the redundant implementation.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
declare fn f() -> Unit

fn f() -> Unit {
  println("only")
}
```

## Suggestion

Remove the redundant declaration:

```moonbit
fn f() -> Unit {
  println("only")
}
```
