# E4157

Unsupported signature in mbti file.

Currently, only abstract type, functions and methods are supported in mbti file.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
package "moonbit-community/E4157"

// Non abstract type is not supported
enum A {
  B
  C
}
```

## Suggestion

Use abstract type instead.

```moonbit
package "moonbit-community/E4157-fixed"

type A
```
