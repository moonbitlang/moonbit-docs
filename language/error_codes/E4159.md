# E4159

Implementations are missing.

When a package implements a
[virtual package](../../toolchain/moon/package.md#virtual-package), it is checked
against the interface of that virtual package, and this error is emitted if some
of the interface is missing.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
package "moonbit-community/E4159";

fn f() -> Unit

fn g() -> Unit
```

```moonbit
///|
fn f() -> Unit {

}
```

## Suggestion

Implement the missing implementations and fulfill the interface. Make sure that
the expected definitions are indeed public.

```moonbit
///|
pub fn f() -> Unit {

}

///|
pub fn g() -> Unit {

}
```
