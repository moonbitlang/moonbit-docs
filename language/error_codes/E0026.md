# E0026

Warning name: `unused_catch_all`

The patterns are complete so the usage of `catch!` is useless. In MoonBit, when
there is only one error type that will be raised in a try block, compiler will
know that the error type is the only one that will be caught. So, there is no
need to use `catch!` in this case.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///|
suberror E

///|
fn f() -> Unit raise E {
  raise E
}

///|
fn g() -> Unit raise {
  f() catch! {
    E => raise E
  }
}

///|
fn main {
  g() catch {
    _ => println("Error")
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

Remove the `!` in the `catch!`:

```moonbit
///|
suberror E

///|
fn f() -> Unit raise E {
  raise E
}

///|
fn g() -> Unit raise {
  f() catch {
    E => raise E
  }
}

///|
fn main {
  g() catch {
    _ => println("Error")
  }
}
```
