# E0011

Warning name: `partial_match`

Partial match. The match/guard/loop expression does not cover all possible
cases.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///|
fn main {
  match Some(1) { // Partial match, some hints: None
    Some(x) => println(x)
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

The warning message usually contains hints about the missing patterns. Add the missing cases to avoid incomplete matches.
You can use [quick fix](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/refactoring#_code-actions-quick-fixes-and-refactorings)
when using [VSCode Plugin](../../toolchain/vscode/index.md#actions).

```moonbit
///|
fn main {
  match Some(1) {
    Some(x) => println(x)
    None => println("None")
  }
}
```

Or, you can use `is` syntax to use this pattern matching as a condition:

```moonbit
///|
/// Example using `is` syntax for conditional pattern matching
pub fn example_with_is() -> Unit {
  if Some(1) is Some(x) {
    println(x)
  }
}
```

Or, you can add a wildcard pattern to catch all remaining cases:

```moonbit
///|
/// Example using wildcard pattern to catch all remaining cases
pub fn example_with_wildcard() -> Unit {
  match Some(1) {
    Some(x) => println(x)
    _ => println("Other")
  }
}
```
