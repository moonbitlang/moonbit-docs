# E0065

Warning name: `prefer_readonly_array`

Suggest `ReadOnlyArray` for read-only array literal.

This warning is emitted when the compiler can infer that an array literal is
used in a read-only way. Consider using `ReadOnlyArray` to better express
intent.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
test {
  let xs = [1, 2, 3]
  inspect(xs[0], content="1")
}
```

## Suggestion

Annotate the array literal as `ReadOnlyArray`:

```moonbit
test {
  let xs : ReadOnlyArray[Int] = [1, 2, 3]
  inspect(xs[0], content="1")
}
```
