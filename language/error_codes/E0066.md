# E0066

Warning name: `prefer_fixed_array`

Suggest `FixedArray` for mutated array literal.

This warning is emitted when an array literal is created and then mutated.
Consider using `FixedArray` to better express intent.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
test {
  let xs = [1, 2, 3]
  xs[0] = 4
  inspect(xs[0], content="4")
}
```

## Suggestion

Annotate the array literal as `FixedArray`:

```moonbit
test {
  let xs : FixedArray[Int] = [1, 2, 3]
  xs[0] = 4
  inspect(xs[0], content="4")
}
```
