# E0042

Warning name: `invalid_attribute`

Invalid attribute.

This warning will be emitted when the program contain attribute unrecognized by MoonBit,
or the syntax of attribute has incorrect shape.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///| unrecognized attribute
#unrecognized
fn f() -> Unit {

}

///| `#deprecated` can accept at most one message
#deprecated("multiple", "message")
fn g() -> Unit {

}
```

## Suggestion

Check if there is typo in the attribute declaration, and check the document of the attribute for the arguments it accept.
If you intend to write a attribute for use by foreign tools,
make sure the attribute's name is `#xxx.yyy`, such as `#coverage.skip`,
so that MoonBit will treat it as a foreign attribute and ignore it.
