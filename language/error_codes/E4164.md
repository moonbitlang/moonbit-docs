# E4164

Type declaration mismatch with mbti.

When a package implements a
[virtual package](../../toolchain/moon/package.md#virtual-package), it is checked
against the interface of that virtual package, and this error is emitted if some
of the type declarations have different arities.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
package "moonbit-community/E4164";

type Foo[_]
```

```moonbit
///|
pub enum Foo {}
```

## Suggestion

Modify the implementation such that it has the compatible signature as the
virtual package it declared to implement.

```moonbit
///|
pub enum Foo[_] {}
```
