# Conversation Management

## Background

If you encounter particularly good conversations (such as those that solved big problems for you, or when MoonPilot performed exceptionally well and you want to share), or if they don't meet expectations and you want to analyze why they weren't good afterward, then conversation management and export become very useful. Let's see how to use them specifically.

## List All Conversations in Current Project

```bash
moon pilot conversations
