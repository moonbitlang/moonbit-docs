# Writing Tests

Tests are important for improving quality and maintainability of a program. They verify the behavior of a program and also serves as a specification to avoid regressions over time.

MoonBit comes with test support to make the writing easier and simpler.

## Test Blocks

MoonBit provides the test code block for writing inline test cases. For example:

```{literalinclude} /sources/language/src/test/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
:start-after: start test 1
:end-before: end test 1
```

A test code block is essentially a function that returns a `Unit` but may throws a `String` on error, or `Unit!String` as one would see in its signature at the position of return type. It is called during the execution of `moon test` and outputs a test report through the build system. The `assert_eq` function is from the standard library; if the assertion fails, it prints an error message and terminates the test. The string `"test_name"` is used to identify the test case and is optional. 

If a test name starts with `"panic"`, it indicates that the expected behavior of the test is to trigger a panic, and the test will only pass if the panic is triggered. For example:

```{literalinclude} /sources/language/src/test/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
:start-after: start test 2
:end-before: end test 2
```

## Snapshot Tests

Writing tests can be tedious when specifying the expected values. Thus, MoonBit provides three kinds of snapshot tests.
All of which can be inserted or updated automatically using `moon test --update`.

### Snapshotting `Show`

We can use `inspect!(x, content="x")` to inspect anything that implements `Show` trait. 
As we mentioned before, `Show` is a builtin trait that can be derived, providing `to_string` that will print the content of the data structures. 
The labelled argument `content` can be omitted as `moon test --update` will insert it for you:

```{literalinclude} /sources/language/src/test/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
:start-after: start snapshot test 1
:end-before: end snapshot test 1
```

### Snapshotting `JSON`

The problem with the derived `Show` trait is that it does not perform pretty printing, resulting in extremely long output.

The solution is to use `@json.inspect!(x, content=x)`. The benefit is that the resulting content is a JSON structure, which can be more readable after being formatted.

```{literalinclude} /sources/language/src/test/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
:start-after: start snapshot test 2
:end-before: end snapshot test 2
```

One can also implement a custom `ToJson` to keep only the essential information.

### Snapshotting Anything

Still, sometimes we want to not only record one data structure but the output of a whole process.

A full snapshot test can be used to record anything using `@test.T::write` and `@test.T::writeln`:

```{literalinclude} /sources/language/src/test/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
:start-after: start snapshot test 3
:end-before: end snapshot test 3
```

This will create a file under `__snapshot__` of that package with the given filename:

```{literalinclude} /sources/language/src/test/__snapshot__/record_anything.txt
```

This can also be used for applications to test the generated output, whether it were creating an image, a video or some custom data.

Please note that `@test.T::snapshot` should be used at the end of a test block, as it always raises exception.

## BlackBox Tests and WhiteBox Tests

When developing libraries, it is important to verify if the user can use it correctly. For example, one may forget to make a type or a function public. That's why MoonBit provides BlackBox tests, allowing developers to have a grasp of how others are feeling.

- A test that has access to all the members in a package is called a WhiteBox tests as we can see everything. Such tests can be defined inline or defined in a file whose name ends with `_wbtest.mbt`.

- A test that has access only to the public members in a package is called a BlackBox tests. Such tests need to be defined in a file whose name ends with `_test.mbt`.

The WhiteBox test files (`_wbtest.mbt`) imports the packages defined in the `import` and `wbtest-import` sections of the package configuration (`moon.pkg.json`).

The BlackBox test files (`_test.mbt`) imports the current package and the packages defined in the `import` and `test-import` sections of the package configuration (`moon.pkg.json`).
