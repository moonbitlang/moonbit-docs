# E4020

Package not found in the loaded packages.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
let a = @boolean.to_int(true)
```

The example above tries to call the method `to_int` in a package `boolean`,
but this package is not present in the list of loaded packages,
giving the following error on line 1:

```
Package "boolean" not found in the loaded packages.
```

## Suggestion

Make sure the package name is valid.

If it is not a package in module `moonbitlang/core`, make sure that it is
mentioned as one of the imported packages in `moon.pkg.json` as well.

In the above example, the package name should be `@bool` instead of `@boolean`:

```moonbit
let a = @bool.to_int(true)
```
