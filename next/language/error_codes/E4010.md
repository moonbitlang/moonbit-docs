# E4010

`pub` is not allowed on default implementation for traits. The default
implementation has the same visibility as the trait itself.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
pub(open) trait Stringer {
  stringify(Self) -> String
}

pub impl Stringer with stringify(_self) { "hey" }
```

In the example above, the `pub` keyword is used on the default implementation of
the `Stringer` trait, which is not allowed.

## Suggestion

Remove the `pub` keyword so that the default implementation has the same
visibility as the trait itself:

```moonbit
pub(open) trait Stringer {
  stringify(Self) -> String
}

impl Stringer with stringify(_self) { "hey" }
```
