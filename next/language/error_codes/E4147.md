Range pattern bounds must satisfy the ordering constraints:

| Pattern | Constraint |
| ------- | ---------- |
| `a..=b` | `a <= b`  |
| `a..<b` | `a < b`   |

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn main {
  let value = 1
  match value {
    0..<-10 => println("0..<-10")
  //^~~~~~~
  // Error: Range pattern `a..<b` must satisfy `a < b`.
    _ => println("_")
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

Make sure the range pattern bounds satisfy the ordering constraints. This can be
usually achieved by swapping the bounds.

```moonbit
fn main {
  let value = 1
  match value {
    -10..<0 => println("0..=10")
    _ => println("_")
  }
}
```
