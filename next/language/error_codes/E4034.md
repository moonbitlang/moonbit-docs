# E4034

Multiple possible struct types detected, please add more annotation.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
fn main {
  struct S { x : Int; y : Int }
  struct T { x : Int; y : Int }
  let c = { x: 2, y: 1 }
}
```

The example above tries to assign a struct with fields `x` and `y` to a variable `c`,
but this field combination matches both `S` and `T` types, giving the following error on line 4:

```
Multiple possible struct types detected: T, S, please add more annotation.
```

## Suggestion

Disambiguate the struct type by adding a type annotation:

```moonbit
fn main {
  struct S { x : Int; y : Int }
  struct T { x : Int; y : Int }
  let c : S = { x: 2, y: 1 }
  let c2 = S::{ x : 2, y : 1 }
}
```
