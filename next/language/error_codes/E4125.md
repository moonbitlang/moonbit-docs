# E4125

`?` operator cannot be used with `..`.

`..` operator allows chaining of method call that returns `Unit`. This is
especially useful when the method performs side-effects, like modifying the
object itself, and thus returns `Unit`.

Using `?` materializes the error that will be raised by the method to
`Result[T, E]`. If one combine the `?` with `..`, the method call will return
`Result[T, E]` instead of `Unit`, which is not allowed by the `..` operator.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
type A Double derive(Show)

pub fn A::check(self : A) -> Unit! {
  if self._.is_nan() {
    fail!("NaN")
  }
}

pub fn A::div(self : A, other : A) -> A {
  A(self._ / other._)
}

fn main {
  let a : A = 1.0
  let b : A = 2.0
  println(a.div(b)..check?())
}
```

## Suggestion

Use the single dot syntax to call the method, and store the result in a
variable.

```moonbit
fn main {
  let a : A = 1.0
  let b : A = 2.0
  println(a.div(b).check?())
}
```
