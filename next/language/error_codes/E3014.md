# E3014

Inline wasm syntax error. MoonBit will check if the inline wasm syntax is correct, including:

- If the parenthesis are correctly matched.
- If the wasm instructions are correctly formatted.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
extern "wasm" fn i32_load(addr : Int) -> Int = // Error: Inline wasm syntax error: unmatched parenthesis at 1:1-1:57
  #|(func (param i32) (result i32)
  #| (i32.load (local.get 0))
```

## Suggestion

Fix the inline wasm syntax as suggested by the warning message.

```moonbit
extern "wasm" fn i32_load(addr : Int) -> Int =
  #|(func (param i32) (result i32)
  #| (i32.load (local.get 0)))
```
