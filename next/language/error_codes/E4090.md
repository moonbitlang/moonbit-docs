Tuples are not mutable. You cannot change the value of a field in a tuple using
assignment.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn main {
  let a = (1, 2, 3)
  a.2 = 4 // Error: tuples are not mutable
  println(a.2)
}
```

## Suggestion

If you need to change the value of a field in a tuple, you should use a struct
instead.

```moonbit
pub struct MyStruct {
  a: Int
  b: Int
  mut c: Int
}

fn main {
  let a : MyStruct = { a : 1, b : 2, c : 3 }
  a.c = 4
  println(a.c)
}
```
