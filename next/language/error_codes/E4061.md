# E4061

Cannot define method of foreign trait for foreign type.

Foreign here means that the type or trait is not defined in the current
package. MoonBit follows the orphan rule, which means that you can only:

| Traits  | Types   | Allowed? |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Native  | Native  | Yes      |
| Foreign | Native  | Yes      |
| Native  | Foreign | Yes      |
| Foreign | Foreign | No       |

## Erroneous example

Suppose you have type `A` and trait `B` defined in package `a` in module
`username/hello`:

`a/a.mbt`:

```moonbit
pub(all) type A Int
pub(open) trait B {
  to_int(Self) -> Int
}
```

`a/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{}
```

Now, if you want to implement trait `@a.B` for type `@a.A`:

`b/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{
  "import": [
    "username/hello/a"
  ]
}
```

`b/b.mbt`:

```moonbit
impl @a.B for @a.A with to_int(self : @a.A) -> Int {
  //                    ^~~~~~
  // Error: Cannot define method to_int of foreign trait @a.B for foreign type @a.A
  self._
}
```

MoonBit will report an error.

## Suggestion

You can move either the trait or type into the current package where the
implementation is in. If that is not possible, you can create a new type over
the foreign type and implement the trait for the new type:

`b/b.mbt`:

```moonbit
type WrapA @a.A

impl @a.B for WrapA with to_int(self : WrapA) -> Int {
  ...
}
```
