# E1013

The type of this expression contains unresolved type variables.

This error occurs when the compiler encounters a type that contains type
variables which cannot be determined from the context. Type variables are
placeholders for types that should be inferred by the compiler.

Common cases where this happens:

1. Writing local functions without explicit type annotations
2. Creating empty collections (Arrays, Options) without specifying their element
   type

When the compiler cannot resolve these type variables, it defaults them to
`Unit` type, which may not be what you intended.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
pub fn f1() -> Unit {
  fn f(x) {
//     ^ Warning: The type of this expression is Option[_/0], which contains
//                unresolved type variables. The type variable is default to
//                Unit.
    match x {
      None => ()
      Some(a) => println(a)
    }
  }

  f(None)
}

pub fn f2() -> Unit {
  fn f(x : Array[_]) -> Int {
//     ^ Warning: The type of this expression is Array[_/0], which contains
//                unresolved type variables. The type variable is default to
//                Unit.
    x.length()
  }

  println(f([]))
}

fn main {
  let a = []
//        ^^ Warning: The type of this expression is Array[_/0], which contains
//           unresolved type variables. The type variable is default to Unit.
  println(a.length())
  let b = None
//        ^^ Warning: The type of this expression is Option[_/0], which contains
//           unresolved type variables. The type variable is default to Unit.
  println(b.is_empty())
}

```

## Suggestion

To fix this warning, you can:

- Add type annotations to local function parameters. For example,

```moonbit
pub fn f1() -> Unit {
  fn f(x: Option[Int]) {
    match x {
      None => ()
      Some(a) => println(a)
    }
  }
  f(None)
}

pub fn f2() -> Unit {
  fn f(x : Array[Int]) -> Int {
    x.length()
  }
  println(f([]))
}
```

- Explicitly specify the type of the variable or the collection element type.

```moonbit
fn main {
  let a : Array[Int] = []
  println(a.length())
  let b : Option[Int] = None
  println(b.is_empty())
}
```

Or equivalently, add annotations on the collection creation.

```moonbit
fn main {
  let a = ([] : Array[Int])
  println(a.length())
  let b = (None : Option[Int])
  println(b.is_empty())
}
```

- Provide enough context through usage.

```moonbit
pub fn f1() -> Unit {
  fn f(x) {
    match x {
      None => ()
      Some(a) => println(a + 1)
//                       ^^^^^ through this usage, the compiler can infer the
//                             type of `x` is `Option[Int]`.
    }
  }
  f(None)
}
```
