# E1028

Unfinished code. In MoonBit, you can use `...` to mark a piece of code that is incomplete. You can still compile and run the code, but it will cause a runtime error when it is executed.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn f() -> Unit {
  ...
}
```

## Suggestion

Complete the code:

```moonbit
fn f() -> Unit {
  println("Hello, world!")
}
```
