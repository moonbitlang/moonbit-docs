# E0039

Warning name: `missing_reasoning`

## Erroneous example

The loop does not have `reasoning` clause.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0039_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Add some reasoning.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0039_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
