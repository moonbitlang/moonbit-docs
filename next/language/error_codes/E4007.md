# E4007

When constructing an enum, the arguments passed to the constructor cannot be unit
`()`. MoonBit does not allow constructors to take unit as an argument because it
would be redundant - a constructor without arguments already represents a
singleton value.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
enum Status {
  Done
  Pending
}

fn main {
  let status = Done() // Error: constructor can't take unit as argument
}
```

## Suggestion

Remove the unit argument from the constructor since it adds no value:

```moonbit
// ...
fn main {
  let status = Done
}
```

If you really need the constructor to take a unit arguments, explicitly use
`Unit` as its argument

```moonbit
enum Status {
  Done(Unit)
  Pending
}

fn main {
  let status = Done(())
}
```
