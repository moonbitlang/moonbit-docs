Found hole _.

If you want to represent unfinished code, we recommend using `...` instead.
Using `...` allows the program to be compiled and run, while `_` will cause a
compilation error.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn main {
  _ // Error: Found hole _
}
```

## Suggestion

Use `...` instead:

```moonbit
fn main {
  ... // Warning: unfinished code
}
```
