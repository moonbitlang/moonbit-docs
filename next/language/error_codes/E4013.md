# E4013

This function has a type which expects a different number of arguments than provided.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
fn f() -> (() -> Int) {
  fn (x: Int) { x }
}
```

The example above declares a function `f` which expects no arguments,
but returns a function that expects one argument.
This will give the following error on line 2:

```
This function has type () -> Int, which expects 0 argument(s), but is given 1 argument(s).
```

## Suggestion

Adjust the code so that the number of arguments in the function type matches the number
of arguments in the function definition:

```moonbit
fn f() -> ((Int) -> Int) {
  fn (x: Int) { x }
}
```

... or:

```moonbit
fn f(x: Int) -> (() -> Int) {
  fn() { x }
}
```
