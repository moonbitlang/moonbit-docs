Cannot define method for foreign type.

Foreign types are types that is not defined in the current package. MoonBit only
allows defining methods or implementing traits for types that are defined in the
current package.

## Erroneous example

In package `a`:

```moonbit
pub type A Int
```

In package `b`:

```moonbit
fn f(self : @a.A) -> Int { // Error: Cannot define method f for foreign type @a.A
  0
}
```

Defining methods for builtin types, or types in standard library, is another
frequent case of this error:

```moonbit
fn f(self : Int) -> Int { // Error: Cannot define method f for foreign type Int
  0
}
```

## Suggestion

You can either move the type definition to the current package:

```moonbit
pub type A Int

fn f(self : A) -> Int {
  0
}
```

Or use new type to wrap the foreign type:

```moonbit
pub type WrapA @a.A

fn f(self : WrapA) -> Int {
  ignore(self._) // Use `._` to access the wrapped value if @a.A is public
  0
}
```
