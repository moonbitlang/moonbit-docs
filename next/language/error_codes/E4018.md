# E4018

Cannot resolve trait for the given type.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
struct S { v : Int }

let s : S = { v: 3 }
let t = Show::to_string(s)
```

The example above tries to call the method `to_string` from
the `Show` trait on a type `S`, but since `S` does not implement
that trait, it gives the following error on line 4:

```
Type S does not implement trait Show: method output is missing
```

## Suggestion

Implement the `Show` trait for the type `S`:

```moonbit
struct S { v : Int }

let s : S = { v: 3 }
let t = Show::to_string(s)

impl Show for S with output(self, logger) {
  logger.write_object(self.v)
}
```
