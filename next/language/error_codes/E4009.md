# E4009

Match function expects a different number of arguments than provided.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
let f = fn {
  0 => 0
  a, b => a + b
}
```

The example defines a match function that has incoherent number of arguments in
different branches. This will result in the following error on line 3:

```
Match function expects 1 arguments, but 2 arguments are provided.
```

## Suggestion

Change the branches so that the number of arguments are exactly the same in all
of them:

```moonbit
let f = fn {
  0 => 0
  a => a
}
```
