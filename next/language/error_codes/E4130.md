`derive` is not allowed for type alias.

Aliases of a type can be used interchangeably with the type itself, so it is not
possible to derive traits for an alias without also deriving them for the type
it aliases. Therefore, MoonBit disallows deriving traits for type aliases.
Instead, one should derive the traits for the type itself.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
struct MyStruct {
  field: Int
}

typealias StructAlias = MyStruct derive(Show) // Error: `derive` is not allowed for type alias
```

## Suggestion

Move the `derive` attribute to the type itself:

```moonbit
struct MyStruct {
  field: Int
} derive(Show)

typealias StructAlias = MyStruct // Remove `derive`
```

If you do not have control over the type, you can create a new type that wraps
the original type. However, deriving traits for a new type requires the wrapped
type to also implement the trait, which is likely not the case if you were using
a type alias in the first place. In this case, you will need to implement the
trait manually.

```moonbit
type StructWrapper MyStruct

impl Show for StructWrapper with output(self, logger) {
  ...
}
```
