# E4130

`derive` is not allowed for type alias.

Aliases of a type can be used interchangeably with the type itself, so it is not
possible to derive traits for an alias without also deriving them for the type
it aliases. Therefore, MoonBit disallows deriving traits for type aliases.
Instead, one should derive the traits for the type itself.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4130_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Move the `derive` attribute to the type itself:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4130_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

If you do not have control over the type, you can create a new type that wraps
the original type. However, deriving traits for a new type requires the wrapped
type to also implement the trait, which is likely not the case if you were using
a type alias in the first place. In this case, you will need to implement the
trait manually.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4130_fixed/top_1.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
