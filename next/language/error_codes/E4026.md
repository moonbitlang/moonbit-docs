# E4026

The field is not found.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
struct T { a : Int }
fn main {
  let t = { b: 42 }
}
```

The example above tries to create a struct with a field `b`,
but no struct with such a field is found in the current scope,
giving the above error on line 3.

## Suggestion

Make sure a struct is available in the current scope,
defined with the correct field name:

```moonbit
struct T { a : Int }
fn main {
  let t = { a: 42 }
}
```

... in the fix above, `t` is inferred to be of type `T`.
