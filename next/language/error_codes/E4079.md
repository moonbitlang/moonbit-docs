# E4079

Cannot derive trait: method is already defined.

This error occurs when you try to derive a trait for a type that already has a
implementation for the trait.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
impl Show for A with output(self : A, logger : &Logger) -> Unit {
  logger.write_object(self._)
}

type A Int derive(Hash, Show) // Error: Cannot derive trait Show for A: method output is already defined at ...
```

## Suggestion

You can pick either the manual implementation or the derived implementation for
the type by removing the other one.

To use the derived implementation:

```moonbit
// Remove the manual implementation
// impl Show for A with output(self : A, logger : &Logger) -> Unit {
//   logger.write_object(self._)
// }

type A Int derive(Hash, Show)
```

Or to use the manual implementation:

```moonbit
impl Show for A with output(self : A, logger : &Logger) -> Unit {
  logger.write_object(self._)
}

type A Int derive(Hash)
```
