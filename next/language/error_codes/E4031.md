# E4031

The constructor is not found.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
enum U { V }
let v : U = W
```

The example above tries to assign a variant `W` to a variable `v` of type `U`,
but this variant doesn't exist, giving the following error on line 2:

```
The variant type U does not have the constructor W.
```

## Suggestion

Make sure to use the correct constructor instead:

```moonbit
enum U { V }
let v : U = V
```
