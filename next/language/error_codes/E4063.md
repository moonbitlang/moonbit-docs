# E4063

Type does not implement trait, although an `impl` is defined.

This error can be further divided into 5 cases:

- Method is missing
- Implementation is private
- Method type mismatch
- Constraints are not satisfied
- Method contains unresolved type parameters

## Erroneous example

### Method is missing

```moonbit
trait Number {
  to_int(Self) -> Int
  to_float(Self) -> Float
}

type A Int

impl Number for A with to_int(self : A) -> Int {
//^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// Error: Type A does not implement trait Number, although an `impl` is defined.
// hint:
//   method to_float is missing.
  self.inner()
}
```

## Suggestion

Modify the code according to the hint provided along with the error message. For
the example above, you can add the missing method `to_float` to type `A`.

```moonbit
impl Number for A with to_float(self : A) -> Float {
  self.inner().to_float()
}
```
