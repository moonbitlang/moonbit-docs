# E1044

Inline wasm code is invalid.

Either the inline wasm code has incorrect syntax, or it refers to unbound function.

## Erroneous example
```moonbit
// unmatched parenthesis
extern "wasm" fn f() =
  #| (func $f

extern "wasm" fn g() =
  #| (func $g (call $does_not_exist))
```

## Suggestion
Here are some pitfalls when writing inline wasm:

- all variables and functions must start with `$`
