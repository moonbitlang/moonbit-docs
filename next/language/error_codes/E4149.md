Cannot call async function in this context.

Async functions can only be called in async functions.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
async fn f() -> Int {
  ...
}

fn g() -> Int {
  f!()
}
```

## Suggestion

You can change the containing function to an async function:

```moonbit
async fn g() -> Int {
  f!()
}
```
