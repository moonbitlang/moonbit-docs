# E4015

Type has no method with the specified name.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
let hey = "hey".upper()
```

The above example tries to call an inexistent method `upper()`
on a string literal, giving the following error on line 1:

```
Type String has no method upper.
```

## Suggestion

This is usually a typo or a misunderstanding of the methods available.
Please make sure to use the correct method name:

```moonbit
let hey = "hey".to_upper()
```
