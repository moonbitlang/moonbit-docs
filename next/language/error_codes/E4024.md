# E4024

The type/trait is not found.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
let a = Sh0w::to_string(true)
```

The example above tries to call the method `to_string` from the `Sh0w` type
(or trait), but this type (or trait) is not found in the current scope,
given the following error on line 1:

```
The type/trait Sh0w is not found.
```

## Suggestion

Make sure the type (or trait) name is correct.

In the above example, you can choose to use a proper trait name `Show`:

```moonbit
let a = Show::to_string(true)
```

... or a proper type name `Bool`:

```moonbit
let a = Bool::to_string(true)
```
