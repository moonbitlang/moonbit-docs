# E3017

JSON parse error. This will only appear in `moon.pkg.json` files only.

It is very like that the editor you are using will have support for JSON
installed (for example, Visual Studio Code has a built-in JSON parser). This
error is likely to be caused by a missing comma or a missing closing brace.

## Erroneous example

```jsonc
{
  "is-main": true
  "import": [] // Error: Expect_comma_or_rbrace
}
```

## Suggestion

```jsonc
{
  "is-main": true,
  "import": []
}
```
