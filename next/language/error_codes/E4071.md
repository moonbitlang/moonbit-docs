# E4071

Multiple intrinsic is not supported. You have defined a function to use multiple
intrinsics.

Note all intrinsic is not intended for usage outside of `moonbitlang/core` and
is subject to change without notice, and we highly recommend **against** using
them.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
type MyArray[T] Array[T]

/// @intrinsic %array.get
/// @intrinsic %fixedarray.get
fn MyArray::get[T](self : MyArray[T], index : Int) -> T { // Error: Multiple intrinsic is not unsupported.
  return self._[index]
}
```

## Suggestion

Remove the extra intrinsic and use only one intrinsic:

```moonbit
/// @intrinsic %array.get
fn MyArray::get[T](self : MyArray[T], index : Int) -> T {
  return self._[index]
}
```

Avoid directly using intrinsics as much as possible, as we may change or remove
them in the future. If you really need to use the intrinsic, you can check the
source code of `moonbitlang/core` for further usage of the corresponding
intrinsic.
