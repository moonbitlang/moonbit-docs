# E4113

Constructor has no field with the given name.

This error occurs when trying to access a field that doesn't exist in a
constructor pattern. In MoonBit, when pattern matching with constructors that
have named fields, you can only access fields that were defined in the
constructor's declaration.

This commonly happens when:

- Misspelling a field name
- Trying to access a field that exists in a different constructor
- Trying to access a field that was removed or renamed in the type definition

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
pub enum E {
  A(a~: Int)
}

pub fn f(x: E) -> Unit {
  match x {
    A(..) as a => {
      println(a.a)
      println(a.b)
//            ^^^ Error: Constructor A of type E has no field b.
    }
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, you can either:

- add the missing field to the constructor

```moonbit
pub enum E {
  A(a~: Int, b~: Bool)
}

pub fn f(x: E) -> Unit {
  match x {
    A(..) as a => {
      println(a.a)
      println(a.b)
    }
  }
}
```

- remove the incorrect field access
