# E4052

The type/trait name duplicates with a previously defined identifier.

This can happen when you define a type and a trait with the same name.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
pub type A
pub trait A {} // Error: The trait A duplicates with type A previously defined at ...
```

## Suggestion

Rename either the type or the trait to a different name.

```moonbit
pub type A
pub trait B {}
```
