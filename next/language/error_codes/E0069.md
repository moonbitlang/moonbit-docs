# E0069

Warning name: `declaration_implemented`

Declaration is already implemented.

This warning is emitted when a declaration is implemented more than once.
Remove the redundant implementation.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0069_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Remove the redundant declaration:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0069_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
