# E0059

Warning name: `unaligned_byte_access`

Unaligned byte access in bits pattern.

This warning is emitted when a bits pattern performs an unaligned byte access.
Consider adjusting the layout or using bit-level fields to keep accesses
aligned.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0059_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Pad to the next byte boundary:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0059_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
