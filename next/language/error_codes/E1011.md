# E1011

Partial match. The match/guard/loop expression does not cover all possible
cases.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///|
fn main {
  match Some(1) { // Partial match, some hints: None
    Some(x) => println(x)
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

The warning message usually contains hints about the missing patterns. Add the missing cases to avoid incomplete matches.

```moonbit
fn main {
  match Some(1) {
    Some(x) => println(x)
  }
}
```

Or, you can use `is` syntax to use this pattern matching as a condition:

```moonbit
fn main {
  if Some(1) is Some(x) {
    println(x)
  }
}
```

Or, you can add a wildcard pattern to catch all remaining cases:

```moonbit
fn main {
  match Some(1) {
    Some(x) => println(x)
    _ => println("Other")
  }
}
```
