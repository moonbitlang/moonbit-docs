# E4103

This loop has incorrect number of patterns supplied.

This error occurs when the number of patterns in a loop arm does not match the
number of loop arguments. In a loop construct, each arm must have the same
number of patterns as there are loop arguments.

For example, if a loop takes 2 arguments, each arm must have exactly 2 patterns
to match against those arguments. Having too few or too many patterns will
trigger this error.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
pub fn f(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int {
  loop x, y {
    0, 0 => 0
    a => continue a - 1, 0
//  ^ Error: This loop has 2 arguments, but 1 patterns are supplied
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, ensure that each arm in the loop has the correct number of
patterns to match the loop arguments. For example,

```moonbit
pub fn f(x: Int, y: Int) -> Int {
  loop x, y {
    0, 0 => 0
    a, b => continue a - 1, b - 1
  }
}
```
