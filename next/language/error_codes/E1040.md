# E1040

This method is declared as `T::f`, Calling this kind of method directly via
name(..) is deprecated, use qualified syntax `T::f(..)`, or declare the method
as `fn f(self : A, ..)` instead.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
type A Int

fn A::f(self : A) -> Int {
  self._
}

fn main {
  let _ = f(A(1))
  // Warning:
  // This method is declared as A::f, calling this kind of method directly via
  // f(..) is deprecated, use qualified syntax A::f(..), or declare the method
  // as `fn f(self : A, ..)` instead.
}
```

## Suggestion

You can either modify the calling of this function at call sites:

```moonbit
fn main {
  let _ = A::f(A(1))
}
```

Or you can define the method as:

```moonbit
fn f(self : A) -> Int {
  self._
}

fn main {
  let _ = f(A(1))
}
```
