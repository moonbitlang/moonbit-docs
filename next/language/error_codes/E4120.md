The application might raise errors, but it's not handled. Try adding an infix
operator `!` or `?` to the application.

In MoonBit, we require programmers to explicitly annotate which functions may
raise errors. This is done by adding an infix operator `!` or `?` to the
function application. The `!` operator to re-raise the error, and the `?`
operator is to materialize the error to a `Result[T, E]` type.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn may_raise_error(input : Int) -> Unit! {
  if input == 42 {
    return
  }
  fail!("failed")
}

fn main {
  may_raise_error(42)
  // Error: The application might raise errors of type Error, but it's not handled.
  // Try adding a infix operator `!` or `?` to the application, so that it looks like `...!(...)` or `...?(...)`.
}
```

## Suggestion

You can either re-raise the error:

```moonbit
fn main {
  try {
    may_raise_error!(42)
  } catch {
    error => println("Error: \{error}")
  }
}
```

Or materialize the error to a `Result[T, E]` type:

```moonbit
fn main {
  let result = may_raise_error?(42)
  println("Result: \{result}")
}
```
