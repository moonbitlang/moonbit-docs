Missing type annotation for the return value.

MoonBit requires all toplevel function to have full type annotation. It is a
common mistake for people to forget to include the return type of a function,
especially when the function returns `Unit`.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn f() { // Error: Missing type annotation for the return value.
}
```

## Suggestion

Add the return type of the function:

```moonbit
fn f() -> Unit {
}
```
