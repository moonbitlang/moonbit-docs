# E4155

Cycle in `const` or `fnalias` declaration.

`const` declaration can refer to other constants defined in the same package,
and `fnalias` can alias other function alias in the same package, too.
But these definitions must not form cycle, otherwise this error will be reported.

## Erroneous example
```moonbit
const A : Int = B + 1
const B : Int = A + 1

fnalias f = g
fnalias g = f
```
