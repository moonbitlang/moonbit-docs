# E4155

Cycle in `const`, `fnalias`, `typealias` or `traitalias` declaration.

`const` declaration can refer to other constants defined in the same package,
and `fnalias` can alias other function alias in the same package, too.
`typealias` and `traitalias` can also refer to other `typealias`/`traitalias` in current package.
But these definitions must not form cycle, otherwise this error will be reported.

## Erroneous example
```moonbit
const A : Int = B + 1
const B : Int = A + 1

fnalias f = g
fnalias g = f

typealias T1 as T2
typealias T2 as T1

traitalias I1 as I2
traitalias I2 as I1
```
