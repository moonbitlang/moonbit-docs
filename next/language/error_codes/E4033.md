# E4033

There is no record definition with the specified fields.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
fn main {
  struct S { x : Int; y : Int }
  let c = { x: 2, w: 1 }
}
```

The example above tries to assign a record with fields `x` and `w` to a variable `c`,
but this field doesn't exist in any known record type, giving the following error on line 3:

```
There is no record definition with the fields: x, w.
```

## Suggestion

Make sure to use the correct field identifiers instead:

```moonbit
fn main {
  struct S { x : Int; y : Int }
  let c = { x: 2, y: 1 }
}
```
