Method has been defined for multiple types.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
let a = to_string(true)
```

The example above tries to call the method `to_string` on a boolean value,
but this method has already been defined for multiple types so that
the compiler cannot properly deduce which method to call,
giving the following error on line 1:

```
Method to_string has been defined for the following types:
<FILE>.mbt:<LINE>:<COLUMN> String
<FILE>.mbt:<LINE>:<COLUMN> Int64
<SNIP>
```

## Suggestion

Disambiguate the method by specifying the type it comes from:

```moonbit
let a = Bool::to_string(true)
```
