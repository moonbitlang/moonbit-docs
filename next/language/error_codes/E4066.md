# E4066

Overloaded operator has inconsistent parameter type.

You can refer to the [Operator Overloading](../methods.md#operator-overloading)
section for a list of operators that can be overloaded, and respectively their
expected signature.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
type A Int
fn A::op_add(self : A, other : Int) -> A {
  return self._ + other
}
```

## Suggestion

Modify the method to match the expected parameter type of the operator. If you
use the name for overloaded operators by accident, you can rename the method to
a different name.

```moonbit
fn A::op_add(self : A, other : A) -> A {
  self._ + other._
}
```
