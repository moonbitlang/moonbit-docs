# E4101

Unsupported expression after the pipe operator.

This error occurs when the expression after the pipe operator (`|>`) is not in a
supported form. The pipe operator allows you to chain function calls in a more
readable way, but only supports specific forms on its right-hand side.

The following forms are allowed after the pipe operator:

1. A single identifier (function name)
2. A regular function application (but not method calls)
3. A constructor name
4. A constructor application

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
type T Int

fn m(self: T, x: Int) -> Unit {
  println(self._ + x)
}

pub fn f(t: T, x: Int) -> Unit {
  x |> fn(x: Int) { println(x)}
//     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Error: Unsupported expression after the pipe operator.
  x |> t.m()
//     ^^^^ Error: Unsupported expression after the pipe operator.
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, you can change the invalid pipe expression to normal function
or method application.

```moonbit
type T Int

fn m(self: T, x: Int) -> Unit {
  println(self._ + x)
}

pub fn f(t: T, x: Int) -> Unit {
  fn(x: Int) { println(x)}(x)
  t.m(x)
}
```
