# E1039

Method name conflicts with another definition.

Note: methods declared with the syntax `fn f(self : T, ..)` will be promoted to
regular function in the future, declare the method using `fn T::f(..)` to avoid
name clash.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
type A Int

fn f() -> Int {
  3
}

fn f(self : A) -> Int {
  self._
}

fn main {
  println(f())
  println(A(3).f())
}
```

## Suggestion

You can defined the method as `A::f`:

```moonbit
fn T::f(self : A) -> Int {
  self._
}
```

However, defining a method with `T::` prefix makes it impossible to be invoked
as regular function. If you wish to call the method as regular function, then
you have to rename either the method name, or the regular function name to
resolve the name clash.

```moonbit
fn f_(self : A) -> Int {
  self._
}

fn main {
  println(f_(A(3)))
}
```
