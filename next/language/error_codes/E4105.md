# E4105

Current loop has result type mismatch with `break` argument.

This error occurs when the type of the argument provided to a `break` statement
does not match the expected result type of the loop. In MoonBit, loops can have
result types, and when using `break` with an argument, that argument's type must
match the loop's result type. When an argument is not provided, the loop's result
type must be `Unit`.

This mismatch can happen in two ways:

1. The loop expects a value of a certain type, but `break` is called with no
   argument
2. The loop expects a value of type A, but `break` is called with an argument of
   type B

For loops with result types, you must ensure that:

- All `break` statements provide an argument of the correct type
- The `else` branch (if present) returns a value of the correct type

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
pub fn g(x: Int) -> Int {
  for i in 0..=x {
    if i == 42 {
      break
//    ^^^^^ Error: Current loop has result type Int, but `break` is supplied
//                 with no arguments.
    }
  } else {
    0
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, you can:

- Add an argument to the `break` statement that matches the loop's result type.
  For example,

```moonbit
pub fn g(x: Int) -> Int {
  for i in 0..=x {
    if i == 42 {
      break i
    }
  } else {
    0
  }
}
```

- Remove the `else` branch if you don't need to return a value from the loop.

```moonbit
pub fn g(x: Int) -> Unit {
  for i in 0..=x {
    if i == 42 {
      break
    }
  }
}
```
