Found cycle in type alias.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
typealias A = B // Found cycle A -> B -> A in type alias.
typealias B = A
```

## Suggestion

You can break cycle using new type:

```moonbit
type A B
typealias B = A
```

However, this is equivalent to writing

```moonbit
type A A
```

And this might not be want to want to do. Therefore, we recommend using
newtypes instead of typealiases in most of times:

```moonbit
type A B
type B A
```
