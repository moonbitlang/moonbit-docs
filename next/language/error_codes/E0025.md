# E0025

Warning name: `test_unqualified_package`

Using implicitly imported API in test.

This warning is emitted when a test uses an API that is implicitly imported.
Prefer adding an explicit import or qualifying the name to make the dependency
clear.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0025_error/top_test.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Use a qualified package name in blackbox tests:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/0025_fixed/top_test.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
