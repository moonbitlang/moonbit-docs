Cannot derive trait for type.

MoonBit allows you to derive implementation of some traits for your types.
However, not all types can be automatically derived. For example, you cannot
derive a trait for an abstract type.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
type T derive(Hash) // Error: Cannot derive trait Hash for type T: target type is abstract
```

## Suggestion

You can implement the trait manually:

```moonbit
type T

impl Hash for T with hash_combine(self : T, hasher: Hasher) {
  // ...
}
```
