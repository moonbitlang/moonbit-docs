# E4060

Method type mismatch.

We require the type of implementation to have the exactly the same type as the
one defined in the trait. Notably, the following types are **not** considered
the same.

- Labelled arguments with different order: `(a~ : Int, b~ : Int) -> Unit` and
  `(b~ : Int, a~ : Int) -> Unit`.
- Optional arguments: `(a : Int, b? : Int) -> Unit` and `(a : Int) -> Unit`.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
trait A {
  f(Self) -> Int
}

type T Int

impl A for T with f(self : T) -> Int {
  //              ^
  // Error: Method f of trait A is expected to have type (T) -> Int,
  //        it cannot be implemented with type (T) -> Unit
  ignore(self)
}
```

## Suggestion

Make sure the method type matches the trait method type.

```moonbit
impl A for T with f(self : T) -> Int {
  ignore(self)
}
```
