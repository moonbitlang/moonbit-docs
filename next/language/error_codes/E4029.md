# E4029

This expression has a type which is not a variant.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
fn main {
  fn f {
    (a, b) => a + b
  }
  let a = f(None)
}
```

The example above tries to call a function `f` with a value `None`,
which is a variant of the `Option[_]` type, but `f` only accepts a tuple,
giving the following error on line 5:

```
This expression has type (Int, Int), which is a tuple type and not a variant.
```

## Suggestions

Make sure to use a value of the correct type instead:

```moonbit
fn main {
  fn f {
    (a, b) => a + b
  }
  let a = f((3, 4))
}
```
