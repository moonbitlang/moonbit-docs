# E4082

Variable is not bound in all patterns.

When using the `|` operator in a pattern, all variables must be bound in all
patterns. If a variable were not bound in all patterns, it would be free
variable when the pattern is matched, which is not allowed.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
enum E {
  A(Int, Double)
  B(Int)
}

fn f(value : E) -> Unit {
  match value {
    A(a, _) | B(_) => println("Hello") // Error: Variable a is not bound in all patterns.
  }
}
```

:language: moonbit
```
