Cannot provide default implementation for foreign trait.

This is a corollary of the [orphan rules of traits and types in
MoonBit](../packages.md#access-control-of-methods-and-trait-implementations).
Default implementation can be seen as implementing the trait for all possible
types, which include foreign and native types. Therefore, it is only possible
for default implementation to be defined in the package of the trait, otherwise
it would violate the orphan rules.

## Erroneous example

Suppose you have a trait `T` defined in package `a` in module `username/hello`:

`a/a.mbt`:

```moonbit
// We need the trait to be pub(open) so that it can be implemented from outside.
pub(open) trait T {
  f(Self) -> Int
}
```

And when you want to define a default implementation for the trait in another
package, say `b`:

`b/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{
  "import": [
    "username/hello/a"
  ]
}
```

`b/b.mbt`:

```moonbit
impl @a.T with f(self : Self) -> Int {
  //           ^
  // Error: Cannot provide default implementation for foreign trait @a.T
  ignore(self)
  0
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, you can move the definition of the trait and the default
implementation of this trait into the same package. Say you can move the trait
definition into package `b`:

`b/b.mbt`:

```moonbit
pub(open) trait T {
  f(Self) -> Int
}

impl T with f(self : Self) -> Int {
  ignore(self)
  0
}
```
