# E4030

The record type does not have the specified field.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
struct T { a : Int }
let t : T = { a: 42 }
let u : T = { ..t, b: 43 }
```

The example above tries to assign an updated record with a field `b`
to a variable `u` of type `T`, but this field doesn't exist,
giving the following error on line 3:

```
The record type T does not have the field b.
```

## Suggestion

Make sure to use the correct field instead:

```moonbit
struct T { a : Int }
let t : T = { a: 42 }
let u : T = { ..t, a: 43 }
```
