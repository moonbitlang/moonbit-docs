# E1008

The modifier (`pub`/`priv`) is redundant here, since this field has such
visibility by default.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
struct A {
  priv value : Int
  // Warning: The private modifier is redundant here
  //          since field value is private by default
}

pub struct B {
  pub value : Int
  // Warning: The public modifier is redundant here
  //          since field value is public by default
}
```

## Suggestion

Remove the visibility modifier on the field.

```moonbit
struct A {
  value : Int
}

pub struct B {
  value : Int
}
```
