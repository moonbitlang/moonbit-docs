# E4016

Please implement the required method for the type to use the infix operator.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
struct S { v : Int }

let s : S = { v: 3 }
let t = s + s
```

The example above tries to use the infix operator `+` on a type `S`
that does not implement the required method `op_add`,
giving the following error on line 4:

```
Please implement the method op_add for the type S to use the infix operator "+".
```

## Suggestion

Implement the required method for the type `S`:

```moonbit
struct S { v : Int }

let s : S = { v: 3 }
let t = s + s

fn S::op_add(self : S, other : S) -> S {
  { v: self.v + other.v }
}
```
