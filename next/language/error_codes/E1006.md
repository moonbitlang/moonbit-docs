# E1006

Variant is never read, never constructed, or both.

- If a variant is never read, it means it is defined but never destructed in a
  pattern matching expression (`match`, `let`, `guard let`, loop function,
  etc.).
- If a variant `A` is never constructed, it means there is no `A(...)`.
- If a variant is unused, it means it is never constructed and never read.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
priv enum T {
  A // Warning: Variant 'A' is never read
  B // Warning: Variant 'B' is never constructed
  C // Warning: Variant 'C' is unused
}

fn main {
  match T::A {
    B => ()
    _ => ()
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

- If some variants are never read, while others are read, this means that you
  have use wildcard pattern (`_`) in your code. You can expand the wildcard
  pattern to include the unused variants.

  ```moonbit
  fn main {
    match T::A {
      B => ()
      C => ()
      A => ()
    }
  }
  ```

- If all variants are never read, and you need to read these variants outside of
  current package, you can add `pub` keyword to the enum definition. Notice this
  will make the implementation of the variant visible to the users of the
  package.

  ```moonbit
  pub enum T {
    A
    B
    C
  }
  ```

- If you need to construct the "never constructed" variant outside of the
  current package, you can add `pub(all)` keyword to the variant.

  ```moonbit
  pub(all) enum T {
    A
    B
    C
  }
  ```

- If some variants are indeed useless, you can remove the unused variants.

  ```moonbit
  enum T {
    A
    B
  }
  ```
