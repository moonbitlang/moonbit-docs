Invalid pragma. The pragma either has invalid id, or has invalid properties.

MoonBit compiler support the following pragmas:

- `@alert`. This pragma is used to emit a warning message. It has the following
  format: `@alert <category> "message"`. For example:

  ```moonbit
  ///|
  /// @alert deprecated "This function is deprecated"
  fn deprecated_function() {
    // ...
  }
  ```

- `@coverage.skip`. This pragma indicates that the following declaration should
  be skipped when calculating code coverage. It has the following format:
  `@coverage.skip`. For example:

  ```moonbit
  ///|
  /// @coverage.skip
  fn function_to_skip() {
    // ...
  }
  ```

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///|
/// @deprecated "This function is deprecated"
fn f() {
  // ...
}
```

## Suggestion

Depending on the pragma you want to use, you should either remove the invalid
pragma, or replace it with a valid one.

```moonbit
///|
/// @alert deprecated "This function is deprecated"
fn f() {
  // ...
}
```
