# E4108

The loop is expected to yield a value, please add an `else` branch.

This error occurs when the compiler infers that a for-loop is expected to yield
a non-Unit value based on its context (such as the function's return type), but
the loop lacks an `else` branch to provide that value.

In MoonBit, when a for-loop is used in a context where a value is expected (for
example, when the function returns a non-Unit type), the loop must have an
`else` branch that specifies what value to return when the loop completes
normally. This is because:

1. The loop body itself cannot yield a value (unlike `loop` expressions)
2. Without an `else` branch, there's no way to determine what value should be
   returned when the loop finishes without breaking

This commonly occurs in two situations:

- When the for-loop is the last expression in a function that returns a non-Unit
  type
- When the for-loop's result is assigned to a variable or used in an expression
  that expects a non-Unit value

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
pub fn f(x: Int) -> Int {
  for i = 0, acc = 0; i < x; i = i + 1, acc = acc + i {
//^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Error: The for loop is
//                                                      not expected to yield a
//                                                      value, please add an
//                                                      `else` branch.
  }
}

pub fn g(x: Int) -> Int {
  for i in 0..=x {
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, you can:

- add an `else` branch to the for-loop:

```moonbit
pub fn f(x: Int) -> Int {
  for i = 0, acc = 0; i < x; i = i + 1, acc = acc + i {
  } else {
    acc
  }
}
```

- change the function's return type to `Unit` if you don't need to return a value
  from the loop:

```moonbit
pub fn g(x: Int) -> Unit {
  for i in 0..=x {
  }
}
```
