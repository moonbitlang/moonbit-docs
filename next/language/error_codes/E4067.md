Missing main function in the main package.

In MoonBit, packages are divided into two types: main packages and non-main
packages. Non-main packages are often used as libraries to provide functionality
to other packages. Main packages, on the other hand, are the entry points of the
program. Therefore, main package should contains a `main` function serving as
the entry point of the program.

## Erroneous example

Suppose in package `main`:

`main/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{ // Error: Missing main function in the main package.
  "is-main": true
}
```

`main/main.mbt`:

```moonbit
type A Int

pub fn A::to_int(self : A) -> Int {
  self._
}
```

## Suggestion

You can add a `main` function to the main package:

`main/main.mbt`:

```moonbit
// ...
fn main {
  let a : A = 42
  println(a.to_int())
}
```

Alternatively, you can set the package to be a non-main package by setting
`"is-main"` to `false` in the package configuration file.

`main/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{
  "is-main": false
}
```
