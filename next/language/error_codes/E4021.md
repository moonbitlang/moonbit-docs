# E4021

The value identifier is unbound.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
let a = @bool.to_integer(true)
```

The example above tries to call the method `to_integer` in a package `@bool`,
but this method is not present in the package `@bool`,
giving the following error on line 1:

```
Value to_integer not found in package `bool`.
```

## Suggestion

Make sure the identifier is correct.

In the above example, the method name should be `to_int` instead of `to_integer`:

```moonbit
let a = @bool.to_int(true)
```
