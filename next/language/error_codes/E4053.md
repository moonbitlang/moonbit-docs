# E4053

Invalid type for "self": must be a type constructor.

This error happens when you want to define a method for implement a trait for a
type that is not a type constructor.

Types that **are** type constructors:

- Tuple: `(Int, Bool)`
- `enum`s, `struct`s, `trait`s, new types (`type`), and error types (`type!`).

Types that **are not** type constructors:

- Function: `(Int) -> Bool`
- Type parameter: `T` in `fn f[T](x : T) -> T`

## Erroneous example

- Defining a method for a type that is not type constructor.

  ```moonbit
  fn f[T](self : T) -> Int { // Error: Invalid type for "self": must be a type constructor.
    ignore(self)
    0
  }

  fn g(self : (Int) -> Unit) -> Unit { // Error: Invalid type for "self": must be a type constructor.
    self(0)
  }
  ```

- Implementing a method for a type that is not a type constructor.

  ```moonbit
  pub trait A {
    f(Self) -> Int
  }

  // Without constraints
  impl[X] A for X with f(self : X) -> Int { // Error: Invalid type for "self": must be a type constructor.
    ignore(self)
    0
  }

  // With constraints
  impl[X: Default] A for X with f(self : X) -> Int { // Error: Invalid type for "self": must be a type constructor.
    ignore(self)
    0
  }
  ```

## Suggestion

When you want to define a method for a type that is not a type constructor, you
may use new type to wrap the type.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4053_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

However, this means you may have to wrap the value with `Wrap` every time you
want to call the method.

If you find yourself implementing a trait for a type parameter, you may also
want to consider using default implementation for the trait.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4053_fixed/top_1.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

If you want to provide the implementation for types with specific constraints,
you can add these constraints to the trait definition.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4053_fixed/top_2.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
