# E4107

Name is declared multiple times in this for-loop.

This error occurs when the same variable name is declared multiple times in the
initialization block of a for-loop. In a for-loop's initialization, each
variable must have a unique name to avoid ambiguity about which value should be
used.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
pub fn f(x: Int) -> Unit {
   for i = 0, i = 1; i < x; i = i + 1 {
//            ^ --- Error: i is declared multiple times in this for-loop
    println(i)
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, you can change the variable name in the initialization block:

```moonbit
pub fn f(x: Int) -> Unit {
  for i = 0, j = 1; i < x; i = i + 1 {
    println(i)
  }
}
```
