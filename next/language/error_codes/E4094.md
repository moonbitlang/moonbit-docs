Cannot modify a read-only field.

For a read-only `struct`, you cannot modify the value of a field using
assignment outside of the package where the type is defined.

## Erroneous example

Suppose you have a package `a` in module `username/hello`:

`a/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{}
```

`a/a.mbt`:

```moonbit
pub struct T {
  mut value : Int
}

pub fn T::new() -> T {
  T::{ value: 0 }
}

pub fn T::set(self : T, value : Int) -> Unit {
  self.value = value
}
```

And you have another package `b` in the same module:

`b/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{
  "is-main": true,
  "import": [
    "username/hello/a"
  ]
}
```

`b/b.mbt`:

```moonbit
fn main {
  let a = @a.T::new()
  a.value = 3 // Error: Cannot modify a read-only field: value
}
```

## Suggestion

If you have control over the package where the type is defined, you can simply
make the struct has `pub(all)` visibility.

`a/a.mbt

```moonbit
pub(all) struct T {
  mut value : Int
}
```

However, this might not be the best solution if you want to hide the
implementation details of the struct or protect the invariant of the struct. We
recommend using getter/setter pattern to guard the access to the struct fields.

`b/b.mbt`:

```moonbit
fn main {
  let a = @a.T::new()
  a.set(3)
}
```
