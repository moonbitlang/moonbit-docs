Values of type `FuncRef[T]` must be capture-free function.

MoonBit provides a builtin type `FuncRef[T]`, which represents capture-free function of type `T`.
In MoonBit's native backend, `FuncRef[T]` corresponds to function pointer type,
so `FuncRef[T]` can be passed to C FFI functions requiring a callback directly, for example setting UNIX signal handler.
Values of type `FuncRef[T]` must be capture-free function type,
if a function with capture or a non-function is supplied, an error will be reported.

## Erroneous example
```moonbit
test {
  let x : Int = 42
  let _ : FuncRef[() -> Unit] = fn () { println(x) }
}
```

## Suggestion
If your callback function really needs to have captures,
consider adding the captures as extra parameters to the function.
