# E3005

There is no such visibility for the entity (function/type/trait/...).

Usually, this means that you put an `priv` visibility modifier on a entity is
by-default private.

See the [Access Control](/language/packages.md#access-control) section of for a
detailed explanation on the visibility in MoonBit.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
priv let value = 3 // Error: No 'priv' visibility for value.
```

## Suggestion

Remove the visibility modifier from the definition of the entity:

```moonbit
let value = 3 // This is already `priv` by default.
```
