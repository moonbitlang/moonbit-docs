# E3005

There is no such visibility for the entity (function/type/trait/...).

Usually, this means that you put an `priv` visibility modifier on a entity is
by-default private.

See the [Access
Control](https://docs.moonbitlang.com/en/latest/language/packages.html#access-control)
section of [MoonBit Language
Documentation](https://docs.moonbitlang.com/en/latest/language/index.html) for a
detailed explanaion on the visibility in MoonBit.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
priv let value = 3 // Error: No 'priv' visibility for value.
```

## Suggestion

Remove the visibility modifier from the definition of the entity:

```moonbit
let value = 3 // This is already `priv` by default.
```
