Mutating something immutable, such as variable or struct field.

MoonBit requires programmers to explicitly declare mutable variables and struct fields.
Notice that in MoonBit, mutability of variable only refers to the variable itself,
not the value it holds.
So when you declare an immutable `let` value of type `Array[T]`, `Ref[T]`, and `struct` with mutable field,
you can still mutate the inner structure, but cannot replace the value of the whole variable.

Tuples are always immutable. If you want mutability, use a `struct` with mutable field instead.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
test {
  let a = @ref.new(0)
  a = @ref.new(1) // Error: The variable a is not mutable.
  a.val = 1 // This is valid, because the mutability come from `Ref` type itself
  println(a)
}

struct S {
  x : Int
}

test {
  let s = { x: 1 }
  s.x = 2 // Error: The field `x` is not mutable.
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, you need to declare the variable as mutable by adding the
`mut` keyword before the variable name or struct field name.

```moonbit
test {
  let mut a = 0
  a = 1
  println(a)
}

struct S {
  mut x : Int
//^^^
}

test {
  let s = { x: 1 }
  s.x = 2
}
```
