The variable is not mutable.

MoonBit requires programmers to explicitly declare mutable variables. Notice
that mutability in MoonBit only refers to the variable itself, not the value it
holds. This means for `Array[T]`, `Ref[T]`, and mutable fields in `struct`, you
don't have to declare them as mutable.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
fn main {
  let a = 0
  a = 1 // Error: The variable a is not mutable.
  println(a)
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, you need to declare the variable as mutable by adding the
`mut` keyword before the variable name.

```moonbit
fn main {
  let mut a = 0
  a = 1
  println(a)
}
```
