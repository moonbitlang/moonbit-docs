Async function call must be marked with `!!`.

MoonBit require all async function calls to be marked with `!!`, as a way to to
inform the programmer that the function call is async and the control flow will
be suspended here.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
async fn f() -> Int {
  ...
}

async fn g() -> Int {
  f() // Error: async function call must be marked with `!!`
}
```

## Suggestion

Mark the async function call with `!!`:

```moonbit
async fn g() -> Int {
  f!!()
}
```
