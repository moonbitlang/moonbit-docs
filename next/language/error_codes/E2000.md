# E2000

The usage of function (type, trait, etc.) is flagged with alert. Usually, alert
message comes with a alert kind and a detailed description of the alert. If you
are using the function from a library, these alerts are set by the library
author to provide some more information on the usage of the function

There are some common alerts that you may encounter:

* `deprecated`: indicates the function (type, trait, etc) is deprecated and
  should not be used or migrate to new APIs.
* `unsafe`: indicates this API panics, breaks internal invariants, has undefined
  behavior under some circumstances. The concrete semantics of this kind of
  alerts may be different across packages, and please consult the documentation
  or the author of these packages for further details.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
/// @alert deprecated "Use `greet` instead"
fn greeting() -> String {
  "Hello!"
}

fn greet(name~ : String = "") -> String {
  if name != "" {
    "Hello!"
  } else {
    "Hello, \{name}!"
  }
}

fn main() -> Unit {
  println(greeting())
  //      ^~~~~~~~ Warning (Alert deprecated): Use `greet` instead(2000)
}
```

## Suggestion

One way to fix the alert, is to change your code as suggested by the message (like `deprecated`):

```moonbit
// ... code in the example above ...
fn main() -> Unit {
  println(greet(name="world"))
}
```

If you clearly know what you are doing and would like to suppress the alert, you can change the `moon.pkg.json` file for packages where you would like to disable **this kind of alert**. For example:

```moonbit
{
  // ... other fields in the file
  "alert-list": "-deprecated"
}
```

NOTE: There is no way to disable alerts for a line/file.
