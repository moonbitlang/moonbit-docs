# E4019

The label is declared twice in this function.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
fn f(g~ : Int, g~ : String) -> Int {
  g
}
```

The above example declares the label `g` twice in the function `f`,
which is not allowed and gives the following error on line 1:

```
The label g~ is declared twice in this function, first in <FILE>.mbt:1:6
```

## Suggestion

Rename one of the labels to avoid the conflict:

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4019_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
