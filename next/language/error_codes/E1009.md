The struct is never constructed.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
pub struct A { // Warning: The struct A is never constructed
  value : Int
}
```

```moonbit
priv struct A { // Warning: The struct A is never constructed
  value : Int
}

fn f(a : A) -> Int {
  a.value
}
```

## Suggestion

The `pub` visibility modifier only allows other packages to access the struct,
by dot-syntax (`a.value`), or by pattern matching. Therefore, if you expect
other packages to be able to construct the struct, you should use the `pub(all)`
visibility modifier.

```moonbit
pub(all) struct A {
  value : Int
}
```

However, if you do not want other packages to construct the struct, this might
be due to incompleteness or bugs in your code. There are some common cases:

- You planned to use smart constructors or factory functions to construct the
  struct, but you forgot or have not implemented them.
- You intend to keep the struct private to control its instantiation but may
  have forgotten to provide a way to do so within its own package.

In these cases, you should consider providing a way to construct the struct
within its own package.

```moonbit
priv struct A {
  value : Int
}

fn A::new(value : Int) -> A {
  A::{ value }
}

fn A::value(self : A) -> Int {
  self.value
}
```
