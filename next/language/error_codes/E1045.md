# E1045

Implementing traits with methods.

Initially, MoonBit allows implementing a trait implicitly with regular methods.
But we intend to deprecate this behavior and allow only explicit `impl` declarations,
to make the language simpler and clearer.
Currently, this deprecation is going through a "graceful migration" period,
and this warning will be emitted if your code uses implicit trait implementation.

## Erroneous example
```moonbit
type MyType Int

fn op_equal(self : MyType, other : MyType) -> Bool {
  self._ == other._
}

test {
  // `==` will call `Eq::op_equal`
  println(MyType(1) == MyType(2))
}
```

## Suggestion
Add an explicit `impl` declaration, or migrate existing method to `impl`.
Notice that `impl` can be called with dot syntax,
so migrating to `impl` should be basically harmless and make the intention of code clearer:
```moonbit
type MyType Int

impl Eq for MyType with op_equal(self, other) {
  self._ == other._
}

test {
  println(MyType(1) == MyType(2))
}
```
