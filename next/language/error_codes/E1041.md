Closed map pattern.

MoonBit's map pattern syntax does not support closed pattern
(i.e. asserting that the map does not contain any other unmatched elements).
So map patterns must always contain a `..`, otherwise this warning will be reported.

## Erroneous example
```moonbit
fn f(map : Map[String, Int]) -> Unit {
  match map {
    // the pattern still matches if `map` contain elements other than "x" and "y"
    { "x": x, "y": y } => println(x + y)
    _ => ()
  }
}

test {
 f({ "x": 1, "y": 2, "z": 3 })
}
```

## Suggestion
- If the intended semantic is open matching (i.e. allow existence of unmatched elements),
  just add `..` to the map pattern.
- If the intended semantic is closed matching, use pattern guard instead:
    ```moonbit
    fn f(map : Map[String, Int]) -> Unit {
      match map {
        { "x": x, "y": y, .. } if map.size() == 2 => println(x + y)
        _ => ()
      }
    }
    ```
