# E4074

This error code is shared by the following two error messages:

- Cannot infer the type of variable, please add more type annotation.
- Public definition a must be annotated with its type.

When defining a toplevel variable using `let`, MoonBit will try to infer its
type when the value is literal:

```moonbit
pub let forty_two = 42
pub let float = 1.0
pub let string = "Hello, world!"
pub let array = [1, 2, 3]
```

## Erroneous example

For "Cannot infer the type of variable a, please add more type annotation":

```moonbit
let a = 1 + 1 // Error: Cannot infer the type of variable a, please add more type annotation.
```

The other error message is more subtle. Say if you have module `username/hello`
and package `a`:

`a/a.mbt`:

```moonbit
pub let value = 1.0
```

And package `b`:

`b/moon.pkg.json`:

```json
{
  "import": [
    "username/hello/a"
  ]
}
```

`b/b.mbt`:

```moonbit
pub let value = @a.value // Error: Public definition a must be annotated with its type.
```

## Suggestion

These two error can be fixed by explicitly annotating the type of the variable:

```moonbit
let a : Int = 1 + 1
```

```moonbit
pub let value : Double = @a.value
```
