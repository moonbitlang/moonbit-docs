# E4041

Partial type is not allowed in toplevel declarations.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
let a : Option[_] = Some(3)
```

The example above tries to create a top-level instance of the `Option[_]` type.
However, partial type annotations are not allowed in toplevel declarations,
giving the aforementioned error on line 1.

## Suggestion

Make sure to provide a complete type annotation:

```moonbit
let a : Option[Int] = Some(3)
```
