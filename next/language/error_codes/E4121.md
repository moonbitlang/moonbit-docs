# E4121

The attribute (`!`, `?`, `!!` mark) cannot be used on this application.

This error occurs when:

- The attribute (`!`, `?`, `!!` mark) is used on a constructor.
- The attribute (`!`, `?`, `!!` mark) is used on a function that does fit.
  - `!` and `?` must be annotated on a function that may raise errors.
  - `!!` must be annotated on an async function.

## Erroneous example

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4121_error/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```

## Suggestion

Remove the attribute (`!`, `?`, `!!` mark) from the application.

```{literalinclude} /sources/error_codes/E4121_fixed/top.mbt
:language: moonbit
```
