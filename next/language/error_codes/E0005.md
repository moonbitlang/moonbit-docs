# E0005

Unused generic type variable.

In some cases, using types with unused generic type variables will make it
impossible for the type checker to infer the type of the unused variable. This
might lead to cryptic error messages, even unexpected runtime behavior.

## Erroneous example

```{include} E0005_example.mbt.md
```

## Suggestion

- If the type variable is indeed useless, remove the unused type variable.

```{include} E0005_suggestion.mbt.md
```

- If you wish to keep the type variable, you can use `_` to indicate that the
  type variable is intentionally unused.

  ```moonbit
  struct Foo[_] {
    bar : Int
  }
  ```
