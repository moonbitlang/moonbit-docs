# E0012

Unreachable code. This usually happens when a `return` statement is followed by
more code. The `return` statement will exit the function immediately, so any
code after it will not be executed.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn main {
  return
  println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Suggestion

Remove the unreachable code, or move it before the `return` statement if you
want the code to be executed.

```moonbit
fn main {
  println("Hello, World!")
  return
}
```
