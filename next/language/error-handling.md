# Error handling in MoonBit

Error handling has always been at core of our language design. In the following
we'll be explaining how error handling is done in MoonBit. We assume
you have some prior knowledge of MoonBit, if not, please checkout [A tour of MoonBit](../tutorial/tour.md).

## Example: Division by Zero

We'll write a small example to demonstrate the basics of MoonBit's error
handling system. Consider the following `div` function which'll raise an error
on division by zero:

```moonbit
type! DivisionByZeroError String
fn div(x : Int, y : Int) -> Int!DivisionByZeroError {
  if y == 0 {
    raise DivisionByZeroError("division by zero")
  }
  x / y
}
```

In before, we would typically use `type` to define a wrapper type which wraps
around some existing foreign type. Here however, we append `type` with `!` to
define a error type `DivisionByZeroError` which wraps around `String`.

> `type! E S` construct a error type `E` from `S`

Just like `type`, `type!` may have a payload like the above `DivisionByZeroError`, or may not, or may even have multiple constructors like a normal `enum`:

```moonbit
type! ConnectionError {
  BrokenPipe(Int,String)
  ConnectionReset
  ConnectionAbort
  ConnectionRefused
}
```

To utilize `DivisionByZeroError` type, we would usually define a function which may raise
error by denoting its return type like `T ! E` in the signature, with `T` being
the actual return type and `E` being the error type. In this case, it's
`Int!DivisionByZeroError`. The error can be thrown using
`raise e` where `e` is an instance of `E` which can be constructed using the
default constructor of `S`.

Any instance of an error is a second class object. Meaning it may only appear in
the return value. And if it does appear, the function signature has to be
adjusted to match with the return type.

The `test` block in MoonBit may also be seen as a function, with a return type
of Unit!Error.

## Calling an error-able function

an error-able function is usually called in 2 manners: `f!(...)` and `f?(...)`.

### As-is calling

`f!(...)` calls the function directly. The possible error must be dealt in the
function that calls `f`. We can either re-raising it without actually dealing
with the error:

```moonbit -e1001 -e1002
// We have to match the error type of `div2` with `div`
fn div2(x : Int, y : Int) -> Int!DivisionByZeroError {
  div!(x,y)
}
```

or use `try...catch` block like in many other languages:

```moonbit
fn div3(x : Int, y : Int) -> Unit {
  try {
    div!(x, y)
  } catch { // `catch` and `except` works the same.
    DivisionByZeroError(e) => println("inf: \{e}")
  } else {
    v => println(v)
  }
}
```

The `catch...` clause has similar semantics like pattern matching. We can unwrap
the error to retrieve the underlying `String` and print it. Additionally,
there's an `else` clause to handle the value of `try...` block.

```moonbit
fn test_try() -> Result[Int, Error] {
  // compiler can figure out the type of a local error-able function.
  fn f() -> _!_ {
    raise Failure("err")
  }

  try Ok(f!()) { err => Err(err) }
}
```

Curly braces may be omitted if the body of try is a one-liner (expression). The
`catch` keyword can also be omitted as well. In the case where a `try` body would raise different errors,
the special `catch!` can be used to catch some of the errors, while re-raising other uncaught errors:

```moonbit
type! E1
type! E2
fn f1() -> Unit!E1 { raise E1 }
fn f2() -> Unit!E2 { raise E2 }
fn f() -> Unit! {
  try {
    f1!()
    f2!()
  } catch! {
    E1 => println("E1")
    // E2 gets re-raised.
  }
}
```

### Convert to Result

#### Extracting values

A object of type `Result` is a first class value in MoonBit. `Result` has 2 constructors: `Ok(...)` and `Err(...)` where the former accept a first class object and the latter accept a error object.

With `f?(...)`, the return type `T!E` is turned into `Result[T,E]`. We may use pattern matching to extract value from it:

```moonbit enclose
let res = div?(10, 0)
match res {
  Ok(x) => println(x)
  Err(DivisionByZeroError(e)) => println(e)
}
```

the `f?()` is basically a syntactic sugar for

```moonbit enclose
let res = try {
  Ok(div!(10, 0))
} catch {
  s => Err(s)
}
```

> Note the difference between `T?` and `f?(...)`: `T` is a type and `T?` is
> equivalent to `Option[T]` whereas `f?(...)` is a call to an error-able function
> `f`.

Besides pattern matching, `Result` provides some useful methods to deal with possible error:

```moonbit no-check
let res1: Result[Int, String] = Err("error")
let value = res1.or(0) // 0

let res2: Result[Int, String] = Ok(42)
let value = res2.unwrap() // 42
```

- `or` returns the value if the result is `Ok` or a default value if it is `Err`
- `unwrap` panics if the result is `Err` and return the value if it is `Ok`

#### Mapping values

```moonbit no-check
let res1: Result[Int, String] = Ok(42)
let new_result = res1.map(fn(x) { x + 1 }) // Ok(43)

let res2: Result[Int, String] = Err("error")
let new_result = res2.map_err(fn(x) { x + "!" }) // Err("error!")
```

- `map` applies a function to the value within, except it doesn't nothing if result is `Err`.
- `map_error` does the opposite.

Unlike some languages, MoonBit treats error-able and nullable value differently. Although one might treat them analogously, as an `Err` result contains no value, only the error, which is like `null`. MoonBit knows that.

- `to_option` converts a `Result` to `Option`.

```moonbit no-check
let res1: Result[Int, String] = Ok(42)
let option = res1.to_option() // Some(42)

let res2: Result[Int, String] = Err("error")
let option1 = res2.to_option() // None
```

## Built-in error type and functions

In MoonBit, `Error` is a generalized error type:

```moonbit no-check
// These signatures are equivalent. They all raise Error.
fn f() -> Unit! { .. }
fn f!() -> Unit { .. }
fn f() -> Unit!Error { .. }

fn test_error() -> Result[Int, Error] {
  fn f() -> _!_ {
    raise DivisionByZeroError("err")
  }

  try {
    Ok(f!())
  } catch {
    err => Err(err)
  }
}
```

Although the constructor `Err` expects a type of `Error`, we may
still pass an error of type `DivisionByZeroError` to it.

But `Error` can't be constructed directly. It's meant to be passed around, not used directly:

```moonbit
type! ArithmeticError

fn what_error_is_this(e : Error) -> Unit {
  match e {
    DivisionByZeroError(_) => println("DivisionByZeroError")
    ArithmeticError => println("ArithmeticError")
    ... => println("...")
    _ => println("Error")
  }
}
```

`Error` is typically used where concrete error type is not needed,
or simply act as a catch-all for all kinds of sub-errors.

As `Error` includes multiple error types, partial matching is not allowed here. We have to do exhaustive matching by providing a catch-all/wildcard case `_`.

We usually use the builtin `Failure` error type for a generalized error, and by
generalized we mean using it for trivial errors that doesn't need a new error type.

```moonbit
fn div_trivial(x : Int, y : Int) -> Int!Failure {
  if y == 0 {
    raise Failure("division by zero")
  }
  x / y
}
```

Besides using the constructor directly, the function `fail!` provides a
shorthand to construct a `Failure`. And if we take a look at the source code:

```moonbit
pub fn fail[T](msg : String, ~loc : SourceLoc = _) -> T!Failure {
  raise Failure("FAILED: \{loc} \{msg}")
}
```

We can see that `fail` is merely a constructor with a pre-defined output
template for showing both the error and the source location. In practice, `fail!`
is always preferred over `Failure`.

Other functions used to break control flow are `abort` and `panic`. They are equivalent. An `panic` at any place will manually crash the program at that place, and prints out stack trace.
