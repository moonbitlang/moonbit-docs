# E4028

This expression has a type which is not a struct.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
struct T { a : Int }
let a : Int = { a: 42 }
```

The example above tries to assign a struct of type `T` to a variable `a` of type `Int`,
which is not possible and gives the following error on line 2:

```default
This expression has type Int, which is a Int type and not a struct.
```

## Suggestion

Make sure to use the correct type instead:

```moonbit
struct T { a : Int }
let a : T = { a: 42 }
```
