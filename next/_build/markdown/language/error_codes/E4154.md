# E4154

Non-constant `enum` with custom tag value.

MoonBit supports customizing the integer representation of constructors:

```moonbit
enum Flag {
  A = 1
  B = 2
  C = 3
}
```

However, only constant `enum` (all constructors have not payload) can have custom tag.
Otherwise this error will be reported.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
enum Bad {
  A = 1
  B = 2
  C(Int)
}
```
