# E4023

The trait is not found.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
let a = true as &Sh0w
```

The example above tries to cast a boolean value to an object
of the `Sh0w` trait, but this trait is not found in the current scope,
giving the following error on line 1:

```default
The trait Sh0w is not found.
```

## Suggestion

Make sure the trait name is correct:

```moonbit
let a = true as &Show
```
