# E4006

This error occurs when the same local function name is declared multiple times within the same scope. Each local function name must be unique within its scope.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
fn main {
  fn helper() {
    1 + 1
  }

  fn helper() { // E4006: local function 'helper' is already defined
    2 + 2
  }

  helper()
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, give each local function a unique name:

```moonbit
fn main {
  fn helper1() {
    1 + 1
  }

  fn helper2() {
    2 + 2
  }

  helper1()
  helper2()
}
```

You can also move one of the functions to a different scope or merge the functionality into a single function if they serve similar purposes.
