Cannot implement trait because it is sealed.

Sealed trait means the trait is not allowed to be implemented in other packages.
Use `pub(open)` to make the trait open to be implemented by other packages.

## Erroneous example

Suppose there is a package `a` in module `username/hello`:

`a/moon.pkg.json`:

```moonbit
{}
```

`a/a.mbt`:

```moonbit
pub trait Sealed {
  to_int() -> Int
}
```

While in package `b`:

`b/moon.pkg.json`:

```moonbit
{
  "import": [
    "username/hello/a"
  ]
}
```

`b/b.mbt`:

```moonbit
type A Int

impl @a.Sealed for A with to_int(self : A) -> Int { // Error: Cannot implement trait '@a.Sealed' because it is readonly.
  self._
}
```

## Suggestion

You can change the visibility of the trait to `pub(open)`, so that it can be
implemented by other packages.

```moonbit
pub(open) trait Sealed {
  to_int() -> Int
}
```
