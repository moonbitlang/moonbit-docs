# E0014

Type name should be capitalized. In MoonBit, we recommend using a capitalized type name for all types, including built-in types and user-defined types. This is a convention that is followed by the standard library and most of the community code.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///|
struct point {
  x : Int
  y : Int
}
```

## Suggestion

Capitalize the type name.

```moonbit
///|
struct Point {
  x : Int
  y : Int
}
```
