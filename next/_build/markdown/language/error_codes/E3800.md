Expecting a newline or `;` here, but encountered another delimiter.

Constructors in `enum` definition, fields in `struct` definition, and
constructors in error type `type!` definition, should be separated by a newline
or a `;`. It is so common for AI to generate code with a wrong delimiter `,`
that we specifically catch this error to help you and AI fix it.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
enum V {
  A, // Error: Expecting a newline or `;` here, but encountered another delimiter `,`.
}

struct S {
  a : Int, // Error: Expecting a newline or `;` here, but encountered another delimiter `,`.
}

type! E {
  A, // Error: Expecting a newline or `;` here, but encountered another delimiter `,`.
}
```

## Suggestion

Replace `,` with a newline or `;` as appropriate. We suggest using a newline
since it conforms to the MoonBit style suggested by the MoonBit formatter.

```moonbit
enum V {
  A
}

struct S {
  a : Int
}

type! E {
  A
}
```
