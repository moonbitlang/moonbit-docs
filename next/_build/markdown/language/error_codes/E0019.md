# E0019

Toplevel declaration is not left aligned. Every toplevel structure in MoonBit
should be left-aligned, i.e. there is no space between the beginning of the line
and the declaration.

Sometimes, earlier parsing errors might causing this error to be raised in the
following lines. Therefore, when your are writing local declarations while
seeing this error, you should check the previous lines for any parsing errors.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
  let x = 1
```

## Suggestion

Remove the leading spaces:

```moonbit
let x = 1
```
