# E4074

This error code is generated when a toplevel declaration is missing necessary type annotation.
MoonBit requires toplevel variables and functions to have fully annotated types,
because types are important documentation for toplevel definitions.

There are two exception to this rule:

- if the value of a toplevel `let` is just a simple literal value, type annotation can be omitted:
  ```moonbit
  pub let forty_two = 42
  pub let float = 1.0
  pub let string = "Hello, world!"
  pub let array = [1, 2, 3]
  ```
- if the value is a private alias of a foreign value.
  In this case, the type can be easily inferred.
  However, for public `let`, MoonBit still requires annotation for documentation sake.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
let a = 1 + 1 // Error: Cannot infer the type of variable a, please add more type annotation.
```

## Suggestion

These two error can be fixed by explicitly annotating the type of the variable:

```moonbit
let a : Int = 1 + 1
```
