# E4117

Function with labelled arguments can only be applied directly.

This means you cannot pass a function with labelled arguments as an argument to another function.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///|
pub fn accumulate(acc~ : Int, value : Int) -> Int {
  acc + value
}

///|
test {
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let sum = xs.fold(init=0, accumulate)
  //                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~
  // Error: Function with labelled arguments can only be applied directly.
}
```

Use [Partial Applications](https://docs.moonbitlang.com/en/latest/language/fundamentals.html#partial-applications) to create non-labelled-arguments-function.

## Suggestion

```moonbit
test {
  let xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  let sum = xs.fold(init=0, accumulate(acc=_,_))
}
```
