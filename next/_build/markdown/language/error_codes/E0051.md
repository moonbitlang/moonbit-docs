# E0051

Ambiguous operator precedence.

Some operators have non-intuitive precedence and can lead to confusion. Always
use parentheses to make the intent clearer in these cases.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///|
pub fn f() -> Int {
  1 + 2 << 3
}
```

## Suggestion

Add parentheses to make the intent clearer.

```moonbit
///|
pub fn f() -> Int {
  (1 + 2) << 3
}
```
