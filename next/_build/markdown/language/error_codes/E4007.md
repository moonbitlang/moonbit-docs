# E4007

Enum variants without payloads are considered as singleton values. MoonBit does
not allow such constructors to be called as functions.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
enum Status {
  Done
  Pending
}

fn main {
  let status = Done() // Error: constructor without payload cannot be called with ()
}
```

## Suggestion

Remove the function calling syntax from the constructor:

```moonbit
// ...
fn main {
  let status = Done
}
```

If you really need the constructor to construct values, explicitly use `Unit` as
its argument

```moonbit
enum Status {
  Done(Unit)
  Pending
}

fn main {
  let status = Done(())
}
```
