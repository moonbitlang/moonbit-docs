Type is not supported by range pattern.

MoonBit only support range pattern for integer types. This error occurs when
you try to use a type that is not an integer in a range pattern.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn main {
  let value = 1.0
  match value {
    _..<0.0 => println("negative") // Error: Type Double is not supported by range pattern.
    _ => println("zero or positive")
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

For type that is not an integer but implements the `Compare` trait, you can use
multiple `if-else` expression to achieve the same effect.

```moonbit
fn main {
  let value = 1.0
  if value < 0.0 {
    println("negative")
  } else {
    println("zero or positive")
  }
}
```
