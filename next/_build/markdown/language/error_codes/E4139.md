# E4139

This expression has type that cannot be implicitly ignored. Use `ignore(...)` or
`let _ = ...` to explicitly ignore it.

`Unit` type can be implicitly ignored.

## Erroneous example

For example,

```moonbit
fn main {
  1 + 1 // This expression has type Int, its value cannot be implicitly ignored.
}
```

The code here show a deeper problem of the logic of the code: discarding the
result makes the computation useless.

## Suggestion

If you do want to discard the result, use `ignore(..)` or `let _ =` to
explicitly discard the value.

```moonbit
fn main {
  ignore(1 + 1)
}
```
