This 'const' declaration is not constant.

In MoonBit, you can use `const` to declare a constant value. Only literal value
of immutable primitive types can be assigned to `const`.

- These are constant values: `1`, `"String"`, `1.0`, `true`, `false`, etc.
- These are not constant values: `[1, 2, 3]`, `1 + 1`, `fn() { 1 }`, etc.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
const A : Int = 1 + 1 // Error: This 'const' declaration is not constant.
```

## Suggestion

As it is not possible to run the computation at compile time and assign the
result to a `const`, you can use a `let` declaration to calculate these result
at initialization time instead.

```moonbit
let a : Int = 1 + 1 // These will be computed at initialization time.
```

If you can compute the value yourself by using, say a calculator, you can
simply assign the result to the `const`.

```moonbit
const A : Int = 2 // This is a constant value.
```
