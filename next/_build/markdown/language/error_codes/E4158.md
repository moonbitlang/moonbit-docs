Default implementation is required but not found.

When a trait declares that it has a default implementation, the implementation
should exist.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///|
pub(open) trait Close {
  // A default implementation is required but not found.
  close(Self) -> Unit raise = _
}
```

## Suggestion

Implement the default implementation.

```moonbit
///|
impl Close with close(_) {
  ()
}
```
