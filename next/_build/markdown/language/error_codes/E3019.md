Inclusive range pattern `a..=b` cannot have `_` as upper bound.

Writing `a..=_` does not make sense, because `_` is a wildcard that matches any
value. It is unclear what does "equals to any value" mean. If you want to
express the meaning of "greater than or equal to `a`", you can use `a..<_`
instead.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn main {
  match 0 {
    0..=_ => println("Big than or equal to 0")
    //  ^
    // Error: Inclusive range pattern `a..=b` cannot have `_` as upper bound
    _ => println("Less than 0")
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

Replace `=` with `<`:

```moonbit
fn main {
  match 0 {
    0..<_ => println("Big than or equal to 0")
    _ => println("Less than 0")
  }
}
```
