# E4106

Unknown binder in the for-loop steps. Binders in the steps must be declared in
the initialization block of the for-loop.

This error occurs when a variable name used in the update expressions (steps) of
a for-loop is not declared in the initialization block of that loop. In a
for-loop, you can only use variables in the update expressions that were
previously declared when initializing the loop.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
pub fn f(x: Int) -> Unit {
  let mut j = 0
  for i = 0; i < x; i = i + 1, j = j + 1 {
//                             ^ --- Error: Unknown binder j in the for-loop
//                                          steps. Binders in the steps must be
//                                          declared in the initialization
//                                          block of the for-loop.
    println(i)
    println(j)
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, you can

- declare the variable `j` in the initialization block of the for-loop. For
  example,

```moonbit
pub fn f(x: Int) -> Unit {
   for i = 0, j = 0; i < x; i = i + 1, j = j + 1 {
    println(i)
    println(j)
  }
}
```

- remove the variable `j` from the update expressions. For example,

```moonbit
pub fn f(x: Int) -> Unit {
  let mut j = 0
  for i = 0; i < x; i = i + 1 {
    println(i)
    println(j)
    j = j + 1
  }
}
```
