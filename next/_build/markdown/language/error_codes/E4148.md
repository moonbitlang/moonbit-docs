The loop label is undeclared.

MoonBit allows programmers to continue to or break from a loop with a label. The
label must be declared at the beginning of one of the loops the `continue` or
`break` statement is in.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn read() -> @bytes.View {
  ...
}

fn main {
  loop read() {
    [] => break
    _ => continue read~ read()
    //            ^~~~~
    // Error: The label read is undeclared.
  }
  // Defining the label here does not work since continue cannot jump to a different loop.
  read~: loop read() {
    [] => break
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

Make sure the label is declared at the beginning of the loop the `continue` or
`break` statement is in.

```moonbit
fn main {
  read~: loop read() {
    [] => break
    _ => continue read~ read()
  }
}
```
