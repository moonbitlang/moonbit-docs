# E0008

The modifier (`pub`/`priv`) is redundant here, since this field has such
visibility by default.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///|
struct A {
  priv value : Int
  //^^
}

///|
pub struct B {
  pub value : Int
  //^
}
```

## Suggestion

Remove the visibility modifier on the field.

```moonbit
///|
struct A {
  value : Int
}

///|
pub struct B {
  value : Int
}
```
