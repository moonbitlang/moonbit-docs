Range operators are currently only supported in `for .. in` loops.

This means you cannot save the range operator in a variable or use it later in
other contexts.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn main {
  let range = 0..<10 // Error: Range operators are currently only supported in `for .. in` loops.
}
```

## Suggestion

One can use the `until` method to generate a range of numbers:

```moonbit
fn main {
  let range = (0).until(10)
  for i in range {
    println(i)
  }
}
```
