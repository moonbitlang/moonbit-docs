# E4059

Cannot define method for builtin types or types that come from other packages.

MoonBit only allows defining methods or implementing traits for types that are
defined in the current package.

## Erroneous example

In package `a`:

```moonbit
pub type A Int
```

In package `b`:

```moonbit
fn f(self : @a.A) -> Int { // Error: Cannot define method f for type @a.A from package a
  0
}
```

Defining methods for builtin types, or types in standard library, is another
frequent case of this error:

```moonbit
fn f(self : Int) -> Int { // Error: Cannot define method f for builtin type Int
  0
}
```

## Suggestion

You can either move the type definition to the current package:

```moonbit
pub type A Int

fn f(self : A) -> Int {
  0
}
```

Or use new type to wrap the builtin type or type from other package:

```moonbit
pub type WrapA @a.A

fn f(self : WrapA) -> Int {
  ignore(self._) // Use `._` to access the wrapped value if @a.A is public
  0
}
```
