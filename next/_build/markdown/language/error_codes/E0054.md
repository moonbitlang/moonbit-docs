# E0054

Async function or method is missing the error annotation.

Asynchronous functions and methods are expected to specify the errors they can
raise.If an async function or method is guaranteed **not** to raise any errors,
it must be explicitly marked with the
[`noraise`](../error-handling.md#throwing-errors) annotation. This
clarifies the function's behavior for anyone using it.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///|
pub async fn println(str : String) -> Unit {
  ...
}
```

## Suggestion

Add `noraise` or `raise E` to the function signature.

```moonbit
///|
pub async fn println(str : String) -> Unit noraise {
  ...
}
```
