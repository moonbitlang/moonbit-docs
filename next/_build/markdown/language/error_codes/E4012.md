# E4012

Mutable constructor fields are only allowed on labelled arguments.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
enum E {
  F(mut x : Int)
}
```

The example above declares an unlabeled mutable field `x` in the
constructor of the `F` variant of the `E` enum, which is not allowed.

## Suggestions

Add a label to the mutable field:

```moonbit
enum E {
  F(mut x~ : Int)
}
```
