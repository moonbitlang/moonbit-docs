# E4100

The type is not a trait.

This error occurs when you try to use the `typealias` syntax to define a alias
for a type and use it as a trait. As it is impossible to use a type as a trait,
this error might hint at a typo in your code.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
type Original Int

typealias Alias = Original

trait Trait: Alias {
  //         ^~~~~
  // Error: The type Alias is not a trait
}
```

## Suggestion

If there is a typo, the use a correct trait or alias of trait at where the error
occurs.

```moonbit
trait Original {
  to_int(Self) -> Int
}

typealias Alias = Original

trait Trait: Alias {
  to_int(Self) -> Int
}
```

We recommend using `traitalias` for defining aliases for traits, as this will
detect errors like this earlier.
