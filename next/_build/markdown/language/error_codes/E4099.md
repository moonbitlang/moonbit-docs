# E4099

A trait is used in context where a type is needed.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
// `Show` is a trait, not a type
fn f(_ : Show) -> Unit {
  
}
```

## Suggestion

If you want to refer to a trait object type, use the syntax `&Trait` instead.

```moonbit
fn f(_ : &Show) -> Unit {

}
```
