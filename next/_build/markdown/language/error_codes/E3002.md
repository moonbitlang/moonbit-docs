# E3002

This source files contains errors in the syntax of the code.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
fn main() -> Unit {
  println("Hello, world!"
}
```

This example gives the following error on line 3:

```default
Parse error, unexpected token `}`, you may expect `,` or `)`.
```

... which indicates a missing closing parenthesis (`)`) in the `println` function call.

## Suggestion

Change your code to strictly follow the MoonBit syntax rules.

In the above example, the missing closing parenthesis should be added:

```moonbit
fn main {
  println("Hello, world!")
}
```
