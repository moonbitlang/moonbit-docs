# E0049

Unused pub definition because it does not exist in mbti file.

A `.mbti` file contains the public interface of a package. When a package
implements a [virtual package](../../toolchain/moon/package.md#virtual-package), it
is checked against the interface of that virtual package, and this warning is
emitted if extra public declarations are found.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
{
  "virtual": {
    "has-default": true
  }
}
```

```moonbit
package "moonbit-community/E0049"
```

```moonbit
///|
pub fn f() -> Unit {

}
```

## Suggestion

Remove the public declarations that does not appear in the interface.
