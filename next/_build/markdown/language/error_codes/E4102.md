# E4102

Outside of a loop.

This error occurs when using `break` or `continue` statements outside of a loop
construct. These control flow statements can only be used within loops.

- `break` is used to exit a loop early
- `continue` is used to skip to the next iteration of a loop

Using these statements outside of a loop context is invalid since there is no
loop to break from or continue to the next iteration.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
pub fn f(xs: Array[Int]) -> Int {
  for i in xs {
    ignore(i)
  } else {
    break 42
//  ^^^^^^^^ Error: 'break' outside of a loop
  }
}

pub fn g(x: Int) -> Int {
  continue x
// ^^^^^^^^ Error: 'continue' outside of a loop
}

fn main {
  let x = { break }
//          ^^^^^ Error: 'break' outside of a loop
  println(x)
}
```

## Suggestion

To fix this error, ensure that `break` and `continue` are used within a loop
construct.
