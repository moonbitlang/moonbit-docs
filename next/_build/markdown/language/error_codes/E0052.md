# E0052

A loop variable is not updated in loop.

When a loop variable is not updated, this could be a potential bug that you have
forgotten to update it, leading to an infinite loop.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
///|
pub fn f() -> Unit {
  for i = 0, radix = 10; i < 10; {
    println(i.to_string(radix~))
  }
}
```

## Suggestion

There are multiple ways to fix this warning:

- If this variable is indeed constant during the loop, you can remove it from
  the initialization and make it constant
- If your code depends on change of the variable, you should update it somewhere
  in the loop.

```moonbit
///|
pub fn f() -> Unit {
  let radix = 10
  for i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1 {
    println(i.to_string(radix~))
  }
}
```
