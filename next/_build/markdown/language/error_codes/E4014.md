# E4014

Type Mismatch.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
fn fst[X, Y] (a: X, b: Y) -> X {
  b
}
```

The above example returns a value `b` of type `Y` on line 2,
which is not the same as the return type `X` of the function.

## Suggestion

Please make sure to return a value of the same type as the return type
of the function.

For instance, in the example above, you may write:

```moonbit
fn fst[X, Y] (a: X, b: Y) -> X {
  a
}
```
