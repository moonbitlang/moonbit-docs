# E0045

Traits with only default implementation need to be explicit implemented with
`impl Trait for Type`.

Initially, if all methods of a trait have default implementations, MoonBit
allowed **any** types to implicitly implement that trait without an explicit
`impl` declaration. This behavior is now deprecated, and you should explicitly
implement traits using the `impl Trait for Type` syntax. Currently, this
deprecation is going through a "graceful migration" period, and this warning
will be emitted if your code uses implicit trait implementation.

## Erroneous example

```moonbit
pub(open) trait Foo {
  foo(Self) -> Unit = _
}

impl Foo with foo(_)  {
}

test {
  let x : Int = 0
  Foo::foo(x)
}
```

## Suggestion

Add an explicit `impl` declaration for types that you wish to implement the
trait for.

```moonbit
impl Foo for Int
```
