# E4046

A public definition cannot depend on private entities.

## Erroneous Example

```moonbit
priv trait I { m(Self) }
pub impl I for Int with m(self) {}
```

The above example tries to implement a private trait `I` for the type `Int`,
but the implementation itself is public, which is not allowed.
This gives the following error on line 2:

```default
A public definition cannot depend on private trait
```

## Suggestion

Adjust the visibility of the trait or the implementation to match:

```moonbit
trait I { m(Self) -> Unit }
pub impl I for Int with m(self) {}
```

... or:

```moonbit
priv trait I { m(Self) -> Unit }
impl I for Int with m(self) {}
```
