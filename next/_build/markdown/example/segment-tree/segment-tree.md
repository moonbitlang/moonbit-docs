# Segment Trees (Part 1)

## What is a Segment Tree?

This section focuses on concepts and theory. If you're already familiar with Segment Trees and their principles, feel free to skip to the next section.

As mentioned in the introduction, Segment Trees address a class of range problems, but what do they look like, and what is the principle behind their excellent complexity?

Let's consider a linear sequence of numbers as an example. If we want to build a Segment Tree from it, it will look like this:

![build segment tree](imgs/segment-tree-build.png)

We can see that we recursively divide the linear sequence into two equal parts (with one side having an extra element if the length is odd) until we reach segments of length one. During this process, we compute the sum of each segment (shown in parentheses), thereby creating a Segment Tree that supports range sum queries from a linear sequence.

So, how does it work when querying a range sum? Let's take the example of querying the sum from index 1 to 6:

![query segment tree](imgs/segment-tree-query.png)

The highlighted parts in the diagram sum up to the total for the range 1-6, and we didn't have to consider all elements; we simply selected the minimum number of segments needed to obtain our result and combined them. We can traverse the Segment Tree from top to bottom to determine the intersections and containment relationships between segments to select the appropriate ranges.

Specifically:

- First, we check the relationship between the ranges 1-7 and 1-6. The latter is a subset of the former, so the data from 1-7 cannot be used in our calculation, and we proceed to explore its two child nodes.
- Next, we check the relationship between 1-3 and 1-6. The former is a subset of the latter, contributing to our result.
- Then, we examine the relationship between 4-7 and 1-6, which overlap, requiring us to explore both child nodes further.
- And we examine the relationship between 4-5 and 1-6, just as the third step.
- We repeat this process...

Based on binary decomposition, we will query at most Log N segments for any range of length N, ensuring guaranteed complexity.

This section only discusses the query operation; we will elaborate on the principles and implementation of modification operations in the next section.

## Implementation

### Basic Definition

We use a classic approach to represent the Segment Tree:

```moonbit
enum Node {
  Nil
  Node(Int, Node, Node)
}
```

Here, `Nil` represents an empty tree, while a `Node` contains the stored data (of type Int) and its left and right children.

### Building the Tree

Building the tree refers to the process of abstracting a linear sequence into a Segment Tree, commonly referred to as `build`.

To start, we should write an overloaded `op_add` function for the `Node` type to assist with the tree-building process:

```moonbit
impl Add for Node with op_add(self : Node, v : Node) -> Node {
  match (self, v) {
    (Node(left, _, _), Node(right, _, _)) => Node(left + right, self, v)
    (Node(_), Nil) => self
    (Nil, Node(_)) => v
    (Nil, Nil) => Nil
  }
}
```

With this operation defined, we can easily merge two `Node` instances while maintaining the segment sums, laying the foundation for building the tree. In some descriptions of Segment Trees, this process is also called `pushup`.

We can leverage MoonBit's `ArrayView` feature (known as `slice` in some languages) to recursively build the tree from a segment of a linear structure at a low cost, achieving O(Log N) complexity:

```moonbit
fn build(data : ArrayView[Int]) -> Node {
  if data.length() == 1 {
    Node(data[0], Nil, Nil)
  } else {
    let mid = (data.length() + 1) >> 1
    build(data[0:mid]) + build(data[mid:])
  }
}
```

Let’s analyze this code:

- If the current length is 1, the segment does not need further subdivision, so we return a leaf node with empty left and right branches.
- Otherwise, we split the segment at the midpoint and recursively build the left and right segments, then merge the results.

This code is concise, highly readable, and optimization-friendly, serving as a great learning paradigm for other data structures.

Now, let's build a tree and test it:

```moonbit
test {
  let tree = build([1, 2, 3, 4, 5][:])
  @json.inspect(tree, content=[
    15,
    [6, [3, [1, "Nil", "Nil"], [2, "Nil", "Nil"]], [3, "Nil", "Nil"]],
    [9, [4, "Nil", "Nil"], [5, "Nil", "Nil"]],
  ])
}
```

Great! We've successfully built the tree!

### Querying

Next, we need to implement the query function. Since the nodes of our Segment Tree maintain segment sums, we can write a `query` function to retrieve these sums:

```moonbit
let empty_node : Node = Node(0, Nil, Nil)

///|
fn query(self : Node, l : Int, r : Int, query_l : Int, query_r : Int) -> Node {
  if query_l > r || l > query_r {
    empty_node
  } else if query_l <= l && query_r >= r {
    self
  } else {
    guard self is Node(_, left, right)
    let mid = (l + r) >> 1
    left.query(l, mid, query_l, query_r) +
    right.query(mid + 1, r, query_l, query_r)
  }
}
```

Here, `l` and `r` represent the currently queried range, while `query_l` and `query_r` denote the range we need to query. Let's break down this implementation:

- If the queried range does not overlap with the current range, it contributes nothing to the result. We define an `empty_node` to represent a zero-contribution node and return it.
- If the current range is a subset of the queried range, it fully contributes to the result, so we return it directly.
- If the current range overlaps with the queried range, we continue searching downwards to find the exact covering ranges, merging the results of the left and right nodes.

#### Before We Continue

Notice the highlighted line. When using the `let` to destructure `Node`, we could be sure that the enum being destructured wasn’t `Nil`. However, the compiler couldn't guarantee this, so we would have received a warning for using:

```moonbit
let Node(x, y) = z
```

Although it didn’t affect execution, it was somewhat misleading. With MoonBit’s newly introduced `guard` statement, we can now handle this better using:

```moonbit
guard let Node(x, y) = z
```

### Q&A

- **Q:** Why use `Node` as the return value? Can't I destructure and sum the values directly?
- **A:** We have defined an addition operation for `Node`. Consider a scenario where we need to maintain not just the sum but also the minimum value of a range. In that case, we can modify the `op_add` logic to maintain the minimum while the `query` function remains unaffected. It ultimately returns a `Node` that can contain all necessary information, so let's stick with using `Node`!
- **Q:** Shouldn't the `empty_node` change in this case?
- **A:** Yes, the `empty_node` ensures that it doesn’t affect the result when added to any other `Node`. It's a zero-contribution node, akin to how 0 contributes nothing in sum operations. For minimum value maintenance, it can represent a value that won't affect the outcome, making the process flexible!

Now, let's test the query process:

```moonbit
test {
  let tree = build([1, 2, 3, 4, 5][:])
  let sum = match tree.query(1, 5, 1, 3) {
    Node(sum, _, _) => sum
    _ => fail("Expected Node")
  }
  inspect(sum, content="6")
}
```

The output is `6`.

Fantastic! We've obtained the correct output!
