"If an abstract type is not used elsewhere in the public interface of a "
"package, then it is not possible for user to interact with the value of that"
" type in any way. Therefore, it is highly probable that the type is part of "
"the private implementation of the package. In this case, it is better to "
"mark the type as `priv` to indicate that it is not part of the public "
"interface of the package."
