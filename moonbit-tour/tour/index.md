# Welcome to the MoonBit language tour! 💫

This tour covers all aspects of the MoonBit language, and assumes you have some prior programming experience. It should teach you everything you need to write real programs in MoonBit.

The tour is interactive! The code shown is editable and will be compiled and evaluated as you type. Anything you print using `println` will be shown in the bottom section. To evaluate MoonBit code the tour compiles MoonBit to wasm gc and runs it, all entirely within your browser window.

If at any point you get stuck or have a question do not hesitate to ask in the MoonBit Discord server. We're here to help, and if you find something confusing then it's likely others will too, and we want to know about it so we can improve the tour.

OK, let's go. Click "Next" to get started, or click "Contents" to jump to a specific topic.
