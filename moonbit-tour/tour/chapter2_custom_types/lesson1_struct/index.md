# Struct

Struct is a new type composed of other types.

In the example we define a struct `Point` with two fields, `x` and `y`, both of which are integers.

We can create an instance of `Point` by writing `{ x: 3, y: 4 }`. The struct name can be omitted since the compiler can infer it from the labels `x` and `y`.

We can also add a `Point::` prefix to create an instance explicitly to disambiguate its type.

Analogous to tuples, we can access the fields of a struct using the syntax `point.x`.

The `derive(Show)` after the struct definition means that we can print the struct using the `println` function.

The fields of a struct are immutable by default; they can't be changed after they are created. There is a syntax called *functional update* that allows you to create a new struct with some fields updated.

We will learn how to make the fields mutable in the next lesson.
