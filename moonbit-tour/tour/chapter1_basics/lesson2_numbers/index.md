# Numbers

Integers and floats are the most common types in MoonBit.
`Int`(32 bit signed integer) can be represented in decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and binary,
and you can use the underscore to separate digits for better readability.
We call these *number literals*.

The `0xFFFF` is a hexadecimal number, `0o777` is an octal number, `0b1010` is a binary number,
and `1_000_000` is a decimal number equivalent to `1000000`.
